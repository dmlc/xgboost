XGBoost Change Log
==================

This file records the changes in xgboost library in reverse chronological order.

## v0.81 (2018.11.04)
### New feature: feature interaction constraints
* Users are now able to control which features (independent variables) are allowed to interact by specifying feature interaction constraints (#3466).
* [Tutorial](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.81/tutorials/feature_interaction_constraint.html) is available, as well as [R](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/9254c58e4dfff6a59dc0829a2ceb02e45ed17cd0/R-package/demo/interaction_constraints.R) and [Python](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/9254c58e4dfff6a59dc0829a2ceb02e45ed17cd0/tests/python/test_interaction_constraints.py) examples.

### New feature: learning to rank using scikit-learn interface
* Learning to rank task is now available for the scikit-learn interface of the Python package (#3560, #3848). It is now possible to integrate the XGBoost ranking model into the scikit-learn learning pipeline.
* Examples of using `XGBRanker` class is found at [demo/rank/rank_sklearn.py](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/24a268a2e3cb17302db3d72da8f04016b7d352d9/demo/rank/rank_sklearn.py).

### New feature: R interface for SHAP interactions
* SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. Previously, this feature was only available from the Python package; now it is available from the R package as well (#3636).

### New feature: GPU predictor now use multiple GPUs to predict
* GPU predictor is now able to utilize multiple GPUs at once to accelerate prediction (#3738)

### New feature: Scale distributed XGBoost to large-scale clusters
* Fix OS file descriptor limit assertion error on large cluster (#3835, dmlc/rabit#73) by replacing `select()` based AllReduce/Broadcast with `poll()` based implementation.
* Mitigate tracker "thundering herd" issue on large cluster. Add exponential backoff retry when workers connect to tracker.
* With this change, we were able to scale to 1.5k executors on a 12 billion row dataset after some tweaks here and there.

### New feature: Additional objective functions for GPUs
* New objective functions ported to GPU: `hinge`, `multi:softmax`, `multi:softprob`, `count:poisson`, `reg:gamma`, `"reg:tweedie`.
* With supported objectives, XGBoost will select the correct devices based on your system and `n_gpus` parameter.

### Major bug fix: learning to rank with XGBoost4J-Spark
* Previously, `repartitionForData` would shuffle data and lose ordering necessary for ranking task.
* To fix this issue, data points within each RDD partition is explicitly group by their group (query session) IDs (#3654). Also handle empty RDD partition carefully (#3750).

### Major bug fix: early stopping fixed in XGBoost4J-Spark
* Earlier implementation of early stopping had incorrect semantics and didn't let users to specify direction for optimizing (maximize / minimize)
* A parameter `maximize_evaluation_metrics` is defined so as to tell whether a metric should be maximized or minimized as part of early stopping criteria (#3808). Also early stopping now has correct semantics.

### API changes
* Column sampling by level (`colsample_bylevel`) is now functional for `hist` algorithm (#3635, #3862)
* GPU tag `gpu:` for regression objectives are now deprecated. XGBoost will select the correct devices automatically (#3643)
* Add `disable_default_eval_metric` parameter to disable default metric (#3606)
* Experimental AVX support for gradient computation is removed (#3752)
* XGBoost4J-Spark
  - Add `rank:ndcg` and `rank:map` to supported objectives (#3697)
* Python package
  - Add `callbacks` argument to `fit()` function of sciki-learn API (#3682)
  - Add `XGBRanker` to scikit-learn interface (#3560, #3848)
  - Add `validate_features` argument to `predict()` function of scikit-learn API (#3653)
  - Allow scikit-learn grid search over parameters specified as keyword arguments (#3791)
  - Add `coef_` and `intercept_` as properties of scikit-learn wrapper (#3855). Some scikit-learn functions expect these properties.

## v0.80 (2018.08.13)
* **JVM packages received a major upgrade**: To consolidate the APIs and improve the user experience, we refactored the design of XGBoost4J-Spark in a significant manner. (#3387)
  - Consolidated APIs: It is now much easier to integrate XGBoost models into a Spark ML pipeline. Users can control behaviors like output leaf prediction results by setting corresponding column names. Training is now more consistent with other Estimators in Spark MLLIB: there is now one single method `fit()` to train decision trees.
  - Better user experience: we refactored the parameters relevant modules in XGBoost4J-Spark to provide both camel-case (Spark ML style) and underscore (XGBoost style) parameters
  - A brand-new tutorial is [available](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.80/jvm/xgboost4j_spark_tutorial.html) for XGBoost4J-Spark.
  - Latest API documentation is now hosted at https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/.
* XGBoost documentation now keeps track of multiple versions:
  - Latest master: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest
  - 0.80 stable: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.80
  - 0.72 stable: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.72
* Ranking task now uses instance weights (#3379)
* Fix inaccurate decimal parsing (#3546)
* New functionality
  - Query ID column support in LIBSVM data files (#2749). This is convenient for performing ranking task in distributed setting.
  - Hinge loss for binary classification (`binary:hinge`) (#3477)
  - Ability to specify delimiter and instance weight column for CSV files (#3546)
  - Ability to use 1-based indexing instead of 0-based (#3546)
* GPU support
  - Quantile sketch, binning, and index compression are now performed on GPU, eliminating PCIe transfer for 'gpu_hist' algorithm (#3319, #3393)
  - Upgrade to NCCL2 for multi-GPU training (#3404).
  - Use shared memory atomics for faster training (#3384).
  - Dynamically allocate GPU memory, to prevent large allocations for deep trees (#3519)
  - Fix memory copy bug for large files (#3472)
* Python package
  - Importing data from Python datatable (#3272)
  - Pre-built binary wheels available for 64-bit Linux and Windows (#3424, #3443)
  - Add new importance measures 'total_gain', 'total_cover' (#3498)
  - Sklearn API now supports saving and loading models (#3192)
  - Arbitrary cross validation fold indices (#3353)
  - `predict()` function in Sklearn API uses `best_ntree_limit` if available, to make early stopping easier to use (#3445)
  - Informational messages are now directed to Python's `print()` rather than standard output (#3438). This way, messages appear inside Jupyter notebooks.
* R package

* Refactored C++ DMatrix class for simplicity and de-duplication (#3301)
* Refactored C++ histogram facilities (#3564)
* Refactored constraints / regularization mechanism for split finding (#3335, #3429). Users may specify an elastic net (L2 + L1 regularization) on leaf weights as well as monotonic constraints on test nodes. The refactor will be useful for a future addition of feature interaction constraints.
* Statically link `libstdc++` for MinGW32 (#3430)
* Enable loading from `group`, `base_margin` and `weight` (see [here](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/input_format.html#auxiliary-files-for-additional-information)) for Python, R, and JVM packages (#3431)

  - Validation of feature names in `Booster.predict()` is now optional (#3323)
* Updated Sklearn API
  - Validation sets now support instance weights (#2354)
  - `XGBClassifier.predict_proba()` should not support `output_margin` option. (#3343) See BREAKING CHANGES below.
* R package:
  - Better handling of NULL in `print.xgb.Booster()` (#3338)
  - Comply with CRAN policy by removing compiler warning suppression (#3329)

  - Fix a compilation error for Scala 2.10 (#3332)
* BREAKING CHANGES
  - `XGBClassifier.predict_proba()` no longer accepts paramter `output_margin`. The paramater makes no sense for `predict_proba()` because the method is to predict class probabilities, not raw margin scores.

## v0.71 (2018.04.11)
* This is a minor release, mainly motivated by issues concerning `pip install`, e.g. #2426, #3189, #3118, and #3194.
  With this release, users of Linux and MacOS will be able to run `pip install` for the most part.
* Refactored linear booster class (`gblinear`), so as to support multiple coordinate descent updaters (#3103, #3134). See BREAKING CHANGES below.
* Fix slow training for multiclass classification with high number of classes (#3109)
* Fix a corner case in approximate quantile sketch (#3167). Applicable for 'hist' and 'gpu_hist' algorithms

  - Fix minor bugs (#3051, #3217)
  - Fix compatibility error for CUDA 9.1 (#3218)

  - Compatibility fixes for latest Spark versions (#3062, #3093)
* BREAKING CHANGES: Updated linear modelling algorithms. In particular L1/L2 regularisation penalties are now normalised to number of training examples. This makes the implementation consistent with sklearn/glmnet. L2 regularisation has also been removed from the intercept. To produce linear models with the old regularisation behaviour, the alpha/lambda regularisation parameters can be manually scaled by dividing them by the number of training examples.

  - User will get a message when approximate algorithm is chosen.
* Change library name to libxgboost.so
* Backward compatiblity
  - The binary buffer file is not backward compatible with previous version.
  - The model file is backward compatible on 64 bit platforms.
* The model file is compatible between 64/32 bit platforms(not yet tested).
* External memory version and other advanced features will be exposed to R library as well on linux.
  - Previously some of the features are blocked due to C++11 and threading limits.
  - The windows version is still blocked due to Rtools do not support ```std::thread```.
* rabit and dmlc-core are maintained through git submodule
  - Anyone can open PR to update these dependencies now.
* Improvements
  - Rabit and xgboost libs are not thread-safe and use thread local PRNGs
  - This could fix some of the previous problem which runs xgboost on multiple threads.
* JVM Package
  - Enable xgboost4j for java and scala
  - XGBoost distributed now runs on Flink and Spark.
* Support model attributes listing for meta data.
