XGBoost Change Log
==================

This file records the changes in xgboost library in reverse chronological order.

## v1.2.0 (2020.08.22)

### XGBoost4J-Spark now supports the GPU algorithm (#5171)
* Now XGBoost4J-Spark is able to leverage NVIDIA GPU hardware to speed up training.
* There is on-going work for accelerating the rest of the data pipeline with NVIDIA GPUs (#5950, #5972).

### XGBoost now supports CUDA 11 (#5808)
* It is now possible to build XGBoost with CUDA 11. Note that we do not yet distribute pre-built binaries built with CUDA 11; all current distributions use CUDA 10.0.

### Better guidance for persisting XGBoost models in an R environment (#5940, #5964)
* Users are strongly encouraged to use `xgb.save()` and `xgb.save.raw()` instead of `saveRDS()`. This is so that the persisted models can be accessed with future releases of XGBoost.
* The previous release (1.1.0) had problems loading models that were saved with `saveRDS()`. This release adds a compatibility layer to restore access to the old RDS files. Note that this is meant to be a temporary measure; users are advised to stop using `saveRDS()` and migrate to `xgb.save()` and `xgb.save.raw()`.

### New objectives and metrics
* The pseudo-Huber loss `reg:pseudohubererror` is added (#5647). The corresponding metric is `mphe`. Right now, the slope is hard-coded to 1.
* The Accelerated Failure Time objective for survival analysis (`survival:aft`) is now accelerated on GPUs (#5714, #5716). The survival metrics `aft-nloglik` and `interval-regression-accuracy` are also accelerated on GPUs.

### Improved integration with scikit-learn
* Added `n_features_in_` attribute to the scikit-learn interface to store the number of features used (#5780). This is useful for integrating with some scikit-learn features such as `StackingClassifier`.  See [this link](https://scikit-learn-enhancement-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/slep010/proposal.html) for more details.
* `XGBoostError` now inherits `ValueError`, which conforms scikit-learn's exception requirement (#5696).

### Improved integration with Dask
* The XGBoost Dask API now exposes an asynchronous interface (#5862). See [the document](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/dask.html#working-with-asyncio) for details.
* Zero-copy ingestion of GPU arrays via `DaskDeviceQuantileDMatrix` (#5623, #5799, #5800, #5803, #5837, #5874, #5901): Previously, the Dask interface had to make 2 data copies: one for concatenating the Dask partition/block into a single block and another for internal representation. To save memory, we introduce `DaskDeviceQuantileDMatrix`. As long as Dask partitions are resident in the GPU memory, `DaskDeviceQuantileDMatrix` is able to ingest them directly without making copies. This matrix type wraps `DeviceQuantileDMatrix`.
* The prediction function now returns GPU Series type if the input is from Dask-cuDF (#5710). This is to preserve the input data type.

### Robust handling of external data types (#5689, #5893)
- As we support more and more external data types, the handling logic has proliferated all over the code base and became hard to keep track. It also became unclear how missing values and threads are handled. We refactored the Python package code to collect all data handling logic to a central location, and now we have an explicit list of of all supported data types.

### Improvements in GPU-side data matrix (`DeviceQuantileDMatrix`)
* The GPU-side data matrix now implements its own quantile sketching logic, so that data don't have to be transported back to the main memory (#5700, #5747, #5760, #5846, #5870, #5898). The GK sketching algorithm is also now better documented.
  - Now we can load extremely sparse dataset like URL, although performance is still sub-optimal.
* The GPU-side data matrix now exposes an iterative interface (#5783), so that users are able to construct a matrix from a data iterator. See the [Python demo](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/release_1.2.0/demo/guide-python/data_iterator.py).

### New language binding: Swift (#5728)
* Visit https://github.com/kongzii/SwiftXGBoost for more details.

### Robust model serialization with JSON (#5772, #5804, #5831, #5857, #5934)
* We continue efforts from the 1.0.0 release to adopt JSON as the format to save and load models robustly.
* JSON model IO is significantly faster and produces smaller model files.
* Round-trip reproducibility is guaranteed, via the introduction of an efficient float-to-string conversion algorithm known as [the RyÅ« algorithm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3192366.3192369). The conversion is locale-independent, producing consistent numeric representation regardless of the locale setting of the user's machine.
* We fixed an issue in loading large JSON files to memory.
* It is now possible to load a JSON file from a remote source such as S3.

### Performance improvements
* CPU hist tree method optimization
  - Skip missing lookup in hist row partitioning if data is dense. (#5644)
  - Specialize training procedures for CPU hist tree method on distributed environment. (#5557)
  - Add single point histogram for CPU hist.  Previously gradient histogram for CPU hist is hard coded to be 64 bit, now users can specify the parameter `single_precision_histogram` to use 32 bit histogram instead for faster training performance. (#5624, #5811)
* GPU hist tree method optimization
  - Removed some unnecessary synchronizations and better memory allocation pattern. (#5707)
  - Optimize GPU Hist for wide dataset.  Previously for wide dataset the atomic operation is performed on global memory, now it can run on shared memory for faster histogram building. But there's a known small regression on GeForce cards with dense data. (#5795, #5926, #5948, #5631)

### API additions
* Support passing fmap to importance plot (#5719). Now importance plot can show actual names of features instead of default ones.
* Support 64bit seed. (#5643)
* A new C API `XGBoosterGetNumFeature` is added for getting number of features in booster (#5856).
* Feature names and feature types are now stored in C++ core and saved in binary DMatrix (#5858).

### Breaking: The `predict()` method of `DaskXGBClassifier` now produces class predictions (#5986). Use `predict_proba()` to obtain probability predictions.
* Previously, `DaskXGBClassifier.predict()` produced probability predictions. This is inconsistent with the behavior of other scikit-learn classifiers, where `predict()` returns class predictions. We make a breaking change in 1.2.0 release so that `DaskXGBClassifier.predict()` now correctly produces class predictions and thus behave like other scikit-learn classifiers. Furthermore, we introduce the `predict_proba()` method for obtaining probability predictions, again to be in line with other scikit-learn classifiers.

### Breaking: Custom evaluation metric now receives raw prediction (#5954)
* Previously, the custom evaluation metric received a transformed prediction result when used with a classifier. Now the custom metric will receive a raw (untransformed) prediction and will need to transform the prediction itself.  See [demo/guide-python/custom\_softmax.py](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/release_1.2.0/demo/guide-python/custom_softmax.py) for an example.
* This change is to make the custom metric behave consistently with the custom objective, which already receives raw prediction (#5564).

### Breaking: XGBoost4J-Spark now requires Spark 3.0 and Scala 2.12 (#5836, #5890)
* Starting with version 3.0, Spark can manage GPU resources and allocate them among executors.
* Spark 3.0 dropped support for Scala 2.11 and now only supports Scala 2.12. Thus, XGBoost4J-Spark also only supports Scala 2.12.

### Breaking: XGBoost Python package now requires Python 3.6 and later (#5715)
* Python 3.6 has many useful features such as f-strings.

### Breaking: XGBoost now adopts the C++14 standard (#5664)
* Make sure to use a sufficiently modern C++ compiler that supports C++14, such as Visual Studio 2017, GCC 5.0+, and Clang 3.4+.

### Bug-fixes
* Fix a data race in the prediction function (#5853). As a byproduct, the prediction function now uses a thread-local data store and became thread-safe.
* Restore capability to run prediction when the test input has fewer features than the training data (#5955). This capability is necessary to support predicting with LIBSVM inputs. The previous release (1.1) had broken this capability, so we restore it in this version with better tests.
* Fix OpenMP build with CMake for R package, to support CMake 3.13 (#5895).
* Fix Windows 2016 build (#5902, #5918).
* Fix edge cases in scikit-learn interface with Pandas input by disabling feature validation. (#5953)
* [R] Enable weighted learning to rank (#5945)
* [R] Fix early stopping with custom objective (#5923)
* Fix NDK Build (#5886)
* Add missing explicit template specializations for greater portability (#5921)
* Handle empty rows in data iterators correctly (#5929). This bug affects file loader and JVM data frames.
* Fix `IsDense` (#5702)
* [jvm-packages] Fix wrong method name `setAllowZeroForMissingValue` (#5740)
* Fix shape inference for Dask predict (#5989)

### Usability Improvements, Documentation
* [Doc] Document that CUDA 10.0 is required (#5872)
* Refactored command line interface (CLI). Now CLI is able to handle user errors and output basic document. (#5574)
* Better error handling in Python: use `raise from` syntax to preserve full stacktrace (#5787).
* The JSON model dump now has a formal schema (#5660, #5818). The benefit is to prevent `dump_model()` function from breaking. See [this document](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/saving_model.html#difference-between-saving-model-and-dumping-model) to understand the difference between saving and dumping models.
* Add a reference to the GPU external memory paper (#5684)

### Maintenance: testing, continuous integration, build system
* [CI] Remove CUDA 9.0 from CI (#5674, #5745)
* Require CUDA 10.0+ in CMake build (#5718)
* [R] Remove dependency on gendef for Visual Studio builds (fixes #5608) (#5764). This enables building XGBoost with GPU support with R 4.x.
* [R-package] Reduce duplication in configure.ac (#5693)
* Bump com.esotericsoftware to 4.0.2 (#5690)
* Migrate some tests from AppVeyor to GitHub Actions to speed up the tests. (#5911, #5917, #5919, #5922, #5928)
* Reduce cost of the Jenkins CI server (#5884, #5904, #5892). We now enforce a daily budget via an automated monitor. We also dramatically reduced the workload for the Windows platform, since the cloud VM cost is vastly greater for Windows.
* [R] Set up automated R linter (#5944)

## v1.1.1 (2020.06.06)
This patch release applies the following patches to 1.1.0 release:

* CPU performance improvement in the PyPI wheels (#5720)
* Fix loading old model (#5724)
* Install pkg-config file (#5744)

## v1.1.0 (2020.05.17)

### Better performance on multi-core CPUs (#5244, #5334, #5522)
* Poor performance scaling of the `hist` algorithm for multi-core CPUs has been under investigation (#3810). #5244 concludes the ongoing effort to improve performance scaling on multi-CPUs, in particular Intel CPUs. Roadmap: #5104
* #5334 makes steps toward reducing memory consumption for the `hist` tree method on CPU.
* #5522 optimizes random number generation for data sampling.

### Deterministic GPU algorithm for regression and classification (#5361)
* GPU algorithm for regression and classification tasks is now deterministic.
* Roadmap: #5023. Currently only single-GPU training is deterministic. Distributed training with multiple GPUs is not yet deterministic.

### Improve external memory support on GPUs (#5093, #5365)
* Starting from 1.0.0 release, we added support for external memory on GPUs to enable training with larger datasets. Gradient-based sampling (#5093) speeds up the external memory algorithm by intelligently sampling a subset of the training data to copy into the GPU memory. [Learn more about out-of-core GPU gradient boosting.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09148)
* GPU-side data sketching now works with data from external memory (#5365).

### Parameter validation: detection of unused or incorrect parameters (#5477, #5569, #5508)
* Mis-spelled training parameter is a common user mistake. In previous versions of XGBoost, mis-spelled parameters were silently ignored. Starting with 1.0.0 release, XGBoost will produce a warning message if there is any unused training parameters. The 1.1.0 release makes parameter validation available to the scikit-learn interface (#5477) and the R binding (#5569).

### Thread-safe, in-place prediction method (#5389, #5512)
* Previously, the prediction method was not thread-safe (#5339). This release adds a new API function `inplace_predict()` that is thread-safe. It is now possible to serve concurrent requests for prediction using a shared model object.
* It is now possible to compute prediction in-place for selected data formats (`numpy.ndarray` / `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` / `cupy.ndarray` / `cudf.DataFrame` / `pd.DataFrame`) without creating a `DMatrix` object.

### Addition of Accelerated Failure Time objective for survival analysis (#4763, #5473, #5486, #5552, #5553)
* Survival analysis (regression) models the time it takes for an event of interest to occur. The target label is potentially censored, i.e. the label is a range rather than a single number. We added a new objective `survival:aft` to support survival analysis. Also added is the new API to specify the ranged labels. Check out [the tutorial](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.1.0/tutorials/aft_survival_analysis.html) and the [demos](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/tree/release_1.1.0/demo/aft_survival).
* GPU support is work in progress (#5714).

### Improved installation experience on Mac OSX (#5597, #5602, #5606, #5701)
* It only takes two commands to install the XGBoost Python package: `brew install libomp` followed by `pip install xgboost`. The installed XGBoost will use all CPU cores. Even better, starting with this release, we distribute pre-compiled binary wheels targeting Mac OSX. Now the install command `pip install xgboost` finishes instantly, as it no longer compiles the C++ source of XGBoost. The last three Mac versions (High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina) are supported.
* R package: the 1.1.0 release fixes the error `Initializing libomp.dylib, but found libomp.dylib already initialized` (#5701)

### Ranking metrics are now accelerated on GPUs (#5380, #5387, #5398)

### GPU-side data matrix to ingest data directly from other GPU libraries (#5420, #5465)
* Previously, data on GPU memory had to be copied back to the main memory before it could be used by XGBoost. Starting with 1.1.0 release, XGBoost provides a dedicated interface (`DeviceQuantileDMatrix`) so that it can ingest data from GPU memory directly. The result is that XGBoost interoperates better with GPU-accelerated data science libraries, such as cuDF, cuPy, and PyTorch.
* Set device in device dmatrix. (#5596)

### Robust model serialization with JSON (#5123, #5217)
* We continue efforts from the 1.0.0 release to adopt JSON as the format to save and load models robustly. Refer to the release note for 1.0.0 to learn more.
* It is now possible to store internal configuration of the trained model (`Booster`) object in R as a JSON string (#5123, #5217).

### Improved integration with Dask
* Pass through `verbose` parameter for dask fit (#5413)
* Use `DMLC_TASK_ID`. (#5415)
* Order the prediction result. (#5416)
* Honor `nthreads` from dask worker. (#5414)
* Enable grid searching with scikit-learn. (#5417)
* Check non-equal when setting threads. (#5421)
* Accept other inputs for prediction. (#5428)
* Fix missing value for scikit-learn interface. (#5435)

### XGBoost4J-Spark: Check number of columns in the data iterator (#5202, #5303)
* Before, the native layer in XGBoost did not know the number of columns (features) ahead of time and had to guess the number of columns by counting the feature index when ingesting data. This method has a failure more in distributed setting: if the training data is highly sparse, some features may be completely missing in one or more worker partitions. Thus, one or more workers may deduce an incorrect data shape, leading to crashes or silently wrong models.
* Enforce correct data shape by passing the number of columns explicitly from the JVM layer into the native layer.

### Major refactoring of the `DMatrix` class
* Continued from 1.0.0 release.
* Remove update prediction cache from predictors. (#5312)
* Predict on Ellpack. (#5327)
* Partial rewrite EllpackPage (#5352)
* Use ellpack for prediction only when sparsepage doesn't exist. (#5504)
* RFC: #4354, Roadmap: #5143

### Breaking: XGBoost Python package now requires Pip 19.0 and higher (#5589)
* Your Linux machine may have an old version of Pip and may attempt to install a source package, leading to long installation time. This is because we are now using `manylinux2010` tag in the binary wheel release. Ensure you have Pip 19.0 or newer by running `python3 -m pip -V` to check the version. Upgrade Pip with command
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
Upgrading to latest pip allows us to depend on newer versions of system libraries. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) also requires Pip 19.0+.

### Breaking: GPU algorithm now requires CUDA 10.0 and higher (#5649)
* CUDA 10.0 is necessary to make the GPU algorithm deterministic (#5361).

### Breaking: `silent` parameter is now removed (#5476)
* Please use `verbosity` instead.

### Breaking: Set `output_margin` to True for custom objectives (#5564)
* Now both R and Python interface custom objectives get un-transformed (raw) prediction outputs.

### Breaking: `Makefile` is now removed. We use CMake exclusively to build XGBoost (#5513)
* Exception: the R package uses Autotools, as the CRAN ecosystem did not yet adopt CMake widely.

### Breaking: `distcol` updater is now removed (#5507)
* The `distcol` updater has been long broken, and currently we lack resources to implement a working implementation from scratch.

### Deprecation notices
* **Python 3.5**. This release is the last release to support Python 3.5. The following release (1.2.0) will require Python 3.6.
* **Scala 2.11**. Currently XGBoost4J supports Scala 2.11. However, if a future release of XGBoost adopts Spark 3, it will not support Scala 2.11, as Spark 3 requires Scala 2.12+. We do not yet know which XGBoost release will adopt Spark 3.

### Known limitations
* (Python package) When early stopping is activated with `early_stopping_rounds` at training time, the prediction method (`xgb.predict()`) behaves in a surprising way. If XGBoost runs for M rounds and chooses iteration N (N < M) as the best iteration, then the prediction method will use M trees by default. To use the best iteration (N trees), users will need to manually take the best iteration field `bst.best_iteration` and pass it as the `ntree_limit` argument to `xgb.predict()`. See #5209 and #4052 for additional context.
* GPU ranking objective is currently not deterministic (#5561).
* When training parameter `reg_lambda` is set to zero, some leaf nodes may be assigned a NaN value. (See [discussion](https://discuss.xgboost.ai/t/still-getting-unexplained-nans-new-replication-code/1383/9).) For now, please set `reg_lambda` to a nonzero value.

### Community and Governance
* The XGBoost Project Management Committee (PMC) is pleased to announce a new committer: Egor Smirnov (@SmirnovEgorRu). He has led a major initiative to improve the performance of XGBoost on multi-core CPUs.

### Bug-fixes

## v1.0.2 (2020.03.03)
This patch release applies the following patches to 1.0.0 release:

* Fix a small typo in sklearn.py that broke multiple eval metrics (#5341)
* Restore loading model from buffer (#5360)
* Use type name for data type check (#5364)

## v1.0.1 (2020.02.21)
This release is identical to the 1.0.0 release, except that it fixes a small bug that rendered 1.0.0 incompatible with Python 3.5. See #5328.

## v1.0.0 (2020.02.19)
This release marks a major milestone for the XGBoost project.

### Apache-style governance, contribution policy, and semantic versioning (#4646, #4659)
* Starting with 1.0.0 release, the XGBoost Project is adopting Apache-style governance. The full community guideline is [available in the doc website](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.0.0/contrib/community.html). Note that we now have Project Management Committee (PMC) who would steward the project on the long-term basis. The PMC is also entrusted to run and fund the project's continuous integration (CI) infrastructure (https://xgboost-ci.net).
* We also adopt the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). See [our release versioning policy](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.0.0/contrib/release.html).

### Better performance scaling for multi-core CPUs (#4502, #4529, #4716, #4851, #5008, #5107, #5138, #5156)
* Poor performance scaling of the `hist` algorithm for multi-core CPUs has been under investigation (#3810). Previous effort #4529 was replaced with a series of pull requests (#5107, #5138, #5156) aimed at achieving the same performance benefits while keeping the C++ codebase legible. The latest performance benchmark results show [up to 5x speedup on Intel CPUs with many cores](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/pull/5156#issuecomment-580024413). Note: #5244, which concludes the effort, will become part of the upcoming release 1.1.0.

### Improved installation experience on Mac OSX (#4672, #5074, #5080, #5146, #5240)
* It used to be quite complicated to install XGBoost on Mac OSX. XGBoost uses OpenMP to distribute work among multiple CPU cores, and Mac's default C++ compiler (Apple Clang) does not come with OpenMP. Existing work-around (using another C++ compiler) was complex and prone to fail with cryptic diagnosis (#4933, #4949, #4969).
* Now it only takes two commands to install XGBoost: `brew install libomp` followed by `pip install xgboost`. The installed XGBoost will use all CPU cores.
* Even better, XGBoost is now available from Homebrew: `brew install xgboost`. See Homebrew/homebrew-core#50467.
* Previously, if you installed the XGBoost R package using the command `install.packages('xgboost')`, it could only use a single CPU core and you would experience slow training performance. With 1.0.0 release, the R package will use all CPU cores out of box.

### Distributed XGBoost now available on Kubernetes (#4621, #4939)
* Check out the [tutorial for setting up distributed XGBoost on a Kubernetes cluster](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.0.0/tutorials/kubernetes.html).

### Ruby binding for XGBoost (#4856)

### New Native Dask interface for multi-GPU and multi-node scaling (#4473, #4507, #4617, #4819, #4907, #4914, #4941, #4942, #4951, #4973, #5048, #5077, #5144, #5270)
* XGBoost now integrates seamlessly with [Dask](https://dask.org/), a lightweight distributed framework for data processing. Together with the first-class support for cuDF data frames (see below), it is now easier than ever to create end-to-end data pipeline running on one or more NVIDIA GPUs.
* Multi-GPU training with Dask is now up to 20% faster than the previous release (#4914, #4951).

### First-class support for cuDF data frames and cuPy arrays (#4737, #4745, #4794, #4850, #4891, #4902, #4918, #4927, #4928, #5053, #5189, #5194, #5206, #5219, #5225)
* [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) is a data frame library for loading and processing tabular data on NVIDIA GPUs. It provides a Pandas-like API.
* [cuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) implements a NumPy-compatible multi-dimensional array on NVIDIA GPUs.
* Now users can keep the data on the GPU memory throughout the end-to-end data pipeline, obviating the need for copying data between the main memory and GPU memory.
* XGBoost can accept any data structure that exposes `__array_interface__` signature, opening way to support other columar formats that are compatible with Apache Arrow.

### [Feature interaction constraint](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.0.0/tutorials/feature_interaction_constraint.html) is now available with `approx` and `gpu_hist` algorithms (#4534, #4587, #4596, #5034).

### Learning to rank is now GPU accelerated (#4873, #5004, #5129)
* Supported ranking objectives: NDGC, Map, Pairwise.
* [Up to 2x improved training performance on GPUs](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/learning-to-rank-with-xgboost-and-gpu/).

### Enable `gamma` parameter for GPU training (#4874, #4953)
* The `gamma` parameter specifies the minimum loss reduction required to add a new split in a tree. A larger value for `gamma` has the effect of pre-pruning the tree, by making harder to add splits.

### External memory for GPU training (#4486, #4526, #4747, #4833, #4879, #5014)
* It is now possible to use NVIDIA GPUs even when the size of training data exceeds the available GPU memory. Note that the external memory support for GPU is still experimental. #5093 will further improve performance and will become part of the upcoming release 1.1.0.
* RFC for enabling external memory with GPU algorithms: #4357

### Improve Scikit-Learn interface (#4558, #4842, #4929, #5049, #5151, #5130, #5227)
* Many users of XGBoost enjoy the convenience and breadth of Scikit-Learn ecosystem. In this release, we revise the Scikit-Learn API of XGBoost (`XGBRegressor`, `XGBClassifier`, and `XGBRanker`) to achieve feature parity with the traditional XGBoost interface (`xgboost.train()`).
* Insert check to validate data shapes.
* Produce an error message if `eval_set` is not a tuple. An error message is better than silently crashing.
* Allow using `numpy.RandomState` object.
* Add `n_jobs` as an alias of `nthread`.
* Roadmap: #5152

### XGBoost4J-Spark: Redesigning checkpointing mechanism
* RFC is available at #4786
* Clean up checkpoint file after a successful training job (#4754): The current implementation in XGBoost4J-Spark does not clean up the checkpoint file after a successful training job. If the user runs another job with the same checkpointing directory, she will get a wrong model because the second job will re-use the checkpoint file left over from the first job. To prevent this scenario, we propose to always clean up the checkpoint file after every successful training job.
* Avoid Multiple Jobs for Checkpointing (#5082): The current method for checkpoint is to collect the booster produced at the last iteration of each checkpoint internal to Driver and persist it in HDFS. The major issue with this approach is that it needs to re-perform the data preparation for training if the user did not choose to cache the training dataset. To avoid re-performing data prep, we build external-memory checkpointing in the XGBoost4J layer as well.
* Enable deterministic repartitioning when checkpoint is enabled (#4807): Distributed algorithm for gradient boosting assumes a fixed partition of the training data between multiple iterations. In previous versions, there was no guarantee that data partition would stay the same, especially when a worker goes down and some data had to recovered from previous checkpoint. In this release, we make data partition deterministic by using the data hash value of each data row in computing the partition.

### XGBoost4J-Spark: handle errors thrown by the native code (#4560)
* All core logic of XGBoost is written in C++, so XGBoost4J-Spark internally uses the C++ code via Java Native Interface (JNI). #4560 adds a proper error handling for any errors or exceptions arising from the C++ code, so that the XGBoost Spark application can be torn down in an orderly fashion.

### XGBoost4J-Spark: Refine method to count the number of alive cores  (#4858)
* The `SparkParallelismTracker` class ensures that sufficient number of executor cores are alive. To that end, it is important to query the number of alive cores reliably.

### XGBoost4J: Add `BigDenseMatrix` to store more than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` elements (#4383)

### Robust model serialization with JSON (#4632, #4708, #4739, #4868, #4936, #4945, #4974, #5086, #5087, #5089, #5091, #5094, #5110, #5111, #5112, #5120, #5137, #5218, #5222, #5236, #5245, #5248, #5281)
* In this release, we introduce an experimental support of using [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) for serializing (saving/loading) XGBoost models and related hyperparameters for training. We would like to eventually replace the old binary format with JSON, since it is an open format and parsers are available in many programming languages and platforms. See [the documentation for model I/O using JSON](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_1.0.0/tutorials/saving_model.html). #3980 explains why JSON was chosen over other alternatives.
* To maximize interoperability and compatibility of the serialized models, we now split serialization into two parts (#4855):
  1. Model, e.g. decision trees and strictly related metadata like `num_features`.
  2. Internal configuration, consisting of training parameters and other configurable parameters. For example, `max_delta_step`, `tree_method`, `objective`, `predictor`, `gpu_id`.

  Previously, users often ran into issues where the model file produced by one machine could not load or run on another machine. For example, models trained using a machine with an NVIDIA GPU could not run on another machine without a GPU (#5291, #5234). The reason is that the old binary format saved some internal configuration that were not universally applicable to all machines, e.g. `predictor='gpu_predictor'`.

  Now, model saving function (`Booster.save_model()` in Python) will save only the model, without internal configuration. This will guarantee that your model file would be used anywhere. Internal configuration will be serialized in limited circumstances such as:
  * Multiple nodes in a distributed system exchange model details over the network.
  * Model checkpointing, to recover from possible crashes.

  This work proved to be useful for parameter validation as well (see below).
* Starting with 1.0.0 release, we will use semantic versioning to indicate whether the model produced by one version of XGBoost would be compatible with another version of XGBoost. Any change in the major version indicates a breaking change in the serialization format.
* We now provide a robust method to save and load scikit-learn related attributes (#5245). Previously, we used Python pickle to save Python attributes related to `XGBClassifier`, `XGBRegressor`, and `XGBRanker` objects. The attributes are necessary to properly interact with scikit-learn. See #4639 for more details. The use of pickling hampered interoperability, as a pickle from one machine may not necessarily work on another machine. Starting with this release, we use an alternative method to serialize the scikit-learn related attributes. The use of Python pickle is now discouraged (#5236, #5281).

### Parameter validation: detection of unused or incorrect parameters (#4553, #4577, #4738, #4801, #4961, #5101, #5157, #5167, #5256)
* Mis-spelled training parameter is a common user mistake. In previous versions of XGBoost, mis-spelled parameters were silently ignored. Starting with 1.0.0 release, XGBoost will produce a warning message if there is any unused training parameters. Currently, parameter validation is available to R users and Python XGBoost API users. We are working to extend its support to scikit-learn users.
* Configuration steps now have well-defined semantics (#4542, #4738), so we know exactly where and how the internal configurable parameters are changed.
* The user can now use `save_config()` function to inspect all (used) training parameters. This is helpful for debugging model performance.

### Allow individual workers to recover from faults (#4808, #4966)
* Status quo: if a worker fails, all workers are shut down and restarted, and learning resumes from the last checkpoint. This involves requesting resources from the scheduler (e.g. Spark) and shuffling all the data again from scratch. Both of these operations can be quite costly and block training for extended periods of time, especially if the training data is big and the number of worker nodes is in the hundreds.
* The proposed solution is to recover the single node that failed, instead of shutting down all workers. The rest of the clusters wait until the single failed worker is bootstrapped and catches up with the rest.
* See roadmap at #4753. Note that this is work in progress. In particular, the feature is not yet available from XGBoost4J-Spark.

### Accurate prediction for DART models
* Use DART tree weights when computing SHAPs (#5050)
* Don't drop trees during DART prediction by default (#5115)
* Fix DART prediction in R (#5204)

### Make external memory more robust
* Fix issues with training with external memory on cpu (#4487)
* Fix crash with approx tree method on cpu (#4510)
* Fix external memory race in `exact` (#4980). Note: `dmlc::ThreadedIter` is not actually thread-safe. We would like to re-design it in the long term.

### Major refactoring of the `DMatrix` class (#4686, #4744, #4748, #5044, #5092, #5108, #5188, #5198)
* Goal 1: improve performance and reduce memory consumption. Right now, if the user trains a model with a NumPy array as training data, the array gets copies 2-3 times before training begins. We'd like to reduce duplication of the data matrix.
* Goal 2: Expose a common interface to external data, unify the way DMatrix objects are constructed and simplify the process of adding new external data sources. This work is essential for ingesting cuPy arrays.
* Goal 3: Handle missing values consistently.
* RFC: #4354, Roadmap: #5143
* This work is also relevant to external memory support on GPUs.

### Breaking: XGBoost Python package now requires Python 3.5 or newer (#5021, #5274)
* Python 3.4 has reached its end-of-life on March 16, 2019, so we now require Python 3.5 or newer.

### Breaking: GPU algorithm now requires CUDA 9.0 and higher (#4527, #4580)

### Breaking: `n_gpus` parameter removed; multi-GPU training now requires a distributed framework (#4579, #4749, #4773, #4810, #4867, #4908)
* #4531 proposed removing support for single-process multi-GPU training. Contributors would focus on multi-GPU support through distributed frameworks such as Dask and Spark, where the framework would be expected to assign a worker process for each GPU independently. By delegating GPU management and data movement to the distributed framework, we can greatly simplify the core XGBoost codebase, make multi-GPU training more robust, and reduce burden for future development.

### Breaking: Some deprecated features have been removed
* ``gpu_exact`` training method (#4527, #4742, #4777). Use ``gpu_hist`` instead.
* ``learning_rates`` parameter in Python (#5155). Use the callback API instead.
* ``num_roots`` (#5059, #5165), since the current training code always uses a single root node.
* GPU-specific objectives (#4690), such as `gpu:reg:linear`. Use objectives without `gpu:` prefix; GPU will be used automatically if your machine has one.

### Breaking: the C API function `XGBoosterPredict()` now asks for an extra parameter `training`.

### Breaking: We now use CMake exclusively to build XGBoost. `Makefile` is being sunset.
* Exception: the R package uses Autotools, as the CRAN ecosystem did not yet adopt CMake widely.

### Performance improvements
* Smarter choice of histogram construction for distributed `gpu_hist` (#4519)
* Optimizations for quantization on device (#4572)
* Introduce caching memory allocator to avoid latency associated with GPU memory allocation (#4554, #4615)

## v0.90 (2019.05.18)

### XGBoost Python package drops Python 2.x (#4379, #4381)
Python 2.x is reaching its end-of-life at the end of this year. [Many scientific Python packages are now moving to drop Python 2.x](https://python3statement.org/).

### XGBoost4J-Spark now requires Spark 2.4.x (#4377)
* Spark 2.3 is reaching its end-of-life soon. See discussion at #4389.
* **Consistent handling of missing values** (#4309, #4349, #4411): Many users had reported issue with inconsistent predictions between XGBoost4J-Spark and the Python XGBoost package. The issue was caused by Spark mis-handling non-zero missing values (NaN, -1, 999 etc). We now alert the user whenever Spark doesn't handle missing values correctly (#4309, #4349). See [the tutorial for dealing with missing values in XGBoost4J-Spark](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.90/jvm/xgboost4j_spark_tutorial.html#dealing-with-missing-values). This fix also depends on the availability of Spark 2.4.x.

### Roadmap: better performance scaling for multi-core CPUs (#4310)
* Poor performance scaling of the `hist` algorithm for multi-core CPUs has been under investigation (#3810). #4310 optimizes quantile sketches and other pre-processing tasks. Special thanks to @SmirnovEgorRu.

### Roadmap: Harden distributed training (#4250)
* Make distributed training in XGBoost more robust by hardening [Rabit](https://github.com/dmlc/rabit), which implements [the AllReduce primitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduce_%28parallel_pattern%29). In particular, improve test coverage on mechanisms for fault tolerance and recovery. Special thanks to @chenqin.

### New feature: Multi-class metric functions for GPUs (#4368)
* Metrics for multi-class classification have been ported to GPU: `merror`, `mlogloss`. Special thanks to @trivialfis.
* With supported metrics, XGBoost will select the correct devices based on your system and `n_gpus` parameter.

### New feature: Scikit-learn-like random forest API (#4148, #4255, #4258)
* XGBoost Python package now offers `XGBRFClassifier` and `XGBRFRegressor` API to train random forests. See [the tutorial](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.90/tutorials/rf.html). Special thanks to @canonizer

### New feature: use external memory in GPU predictor (#4284, #4396, #4438, #4457)
* It is now possible to make predictions on GPU when the input is read from external memory. This is useful when you want to make predictions with big dataset that does not fit into the GPU memory. Special thanks to @rongou, @canonizer, @sriramch.

  ```python
  dtest = xgboost.DMatrix('test_data.libsvm#dtest.cache')
  bst.set_param('predictor', 'gpu_predictor')
  bst.predict(dtest)
  ```

* Coming soon: GPU training (`gpu_hist`) with external memory

### New feature: XGBoost can now handle comments in LIBSVM files (#4430)
* Special thanks to @trivialfis and @hcho3

### New feature: Embed XGBoost in your C/C++ applications using CMake (#4323, #4333, #4453)
* It is now easier than ever to embed XGBoost in your C/C++ applications. In your CMakeLists.txt, add `xgboost::xgboost` as a linked library:

  ```cmake
  find_package(xgboost REQUIRED)
  add_executable(api-demo c-api-demo.c)
  target_link_libraries(api-demo xgboost::xgboost)
  ```

  [XGBoost C API documentation is available.](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.90/dev) Special thanks to @trivialfis

## v0.82 (2019.03.03)
This release is packed with many new features and bug fixes.

### Roadmap: better performance scaling for multi-core CPUs (#3957)
* Poor performance scaling of the `hist` algorithm for multi-core CPUs has been under investigation (#3810). #3957 marks an important step toward better performance scaling, by using software pre-fetching and replacing STL vectors with C-style arrays. Special thanks to @Laurae2 and @SmirnovEgorRu.
* See #3810 for latest progress on this roadmap.

### New feature: Distributed Fast Histogram Algorithm (`hist`) (#4011, #4102, #4140, #4128)
* It is now possible to run the `hist` algorithm in distributed setting. Special thanks to @CodingCat. The benefits include:
  1. Faster local computation via feature binning
  2. Support for monotonic constraints and feature interaction constraints
  3. Simpler codebase than `approx`, allowing for future improvement
* Depth-wise tree growing is now performed in a separate code path, so that cross-node syncronization is performed only once per level.

### New feature: Multi-Node, Multi-GPU training (#4095)
* Distributed training is now able to utilize clusters equipped with NVIDIA GPUs. In particular, the rabit AllReduce layer will communicate GPU device information. Special thanks to @mt-jones, @RAMitchell, @rongou, @trivialfis, @canonizer, and @jeffdk.
* Resource management systems will be able to assign a rank for each GPU in the cluster.
* In Dask, users will be able to construct a collection of XGBoost processes over an inhomogeneous device cluster (i.e. workers with different number and/or kinds of GPUs).

### New feature: Multiple validation datasets in XGBoost4J-Spark (#3904, #3910)
* You can now track the performance of the model during training with multiple evaluation datasets. By specifying `eval_sets` or call `setEvalSets` over a `XGBoostClassifier` or `XGBoostRegressor`, you can pass in multiple evaluation datasets typed as a `Map` from `String` to `DataFrame`. Special thanks to @CodingCat.
* See the usage of multiple validation datasets [here](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/0c1d5f1120c0a159f2567b267f0ec4ffadee00d0/jvm-packages/xgboost4j-example/src/main/scala/ml/dmlc/xgboost4j/scala/example/spark/SparkTraining.scala#L66-L78)

### New feature: Additional metric functions for GPUs (#3952)
* Element-wise metrics have been ported to GPU: `rmse`, `mae`, `logloss`, `poisson-nloglik`, `gamma-deviance`, `gamma-nloglik`, `error`, `tweedie-nloglik`. Special thanks to @trivialfis and @RAMitchell.
* With supported metrics, XGBoost will select the correct devices based on your system and `n_gpus` parameter.

### New feature: Column sampling at individual nodes (splits) (#3971)
* Columns (features) can now be sampled at individual tree nodes, in addition to per-tree and per-level sampling. To enable per-node sampling, set `colsample_bynode` parameter, which represents the fraction of columns sampled at each node. This parameter is set to 1.0 by default (i.e. no sampling per node). Special thanks to @canonizer.
* The `colsample_bynode` parameter works cumulatively with other `colsample_by*` parameters: for example, `{'colsample_bynode':0.5, 'colsample_bytree':0.5}` with 100 columns will give 25 features to choose from at each split.

### Major API change: consistent logging level via `verbosity` (#3982, #4002, #4138)
* XGBoost now allows fine-grained control over logging. You can set `verbosity` to 0 (silent), 1 (warning), 2 (info), and 3 (debug). This is useful for controlling the amount of logging outputs. Special thanks to @trivialfis.
* Parameters `silent` and `debug_verbose` are now deprecated.
* Note: Sometimes XGBoost tries to change configurations based on heuristics, which is displayed as warning message.  If there's unexpected behaviour, please try to increase value of verbosity.

### Major bug fix: external memory (#4040, #4193)
* Clarify object ownership in multi-threaded prefetcher, to avoid memory error.
* Correctly merge two column batches (which uses [CSC layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_column_(CSC_or_CCS))).
* Add unit tests for external memory.
* Special thanks to @trivialfis and @hcho3.

### Major bug fix: early stopping fixed in XGBoost4J and XGBoost4J-Spark (#3928, #4176)
* Early stopping in XGBoost4J and XGBoost4J-Spark is now consistent with its counterpart in the Python package. Training stops if the current iteration is `earlyStoppingSteps` away from the best iteration. If there are multiple evaluation sets, only the last one is used to determinate early stop.
* See the updated documentation [here](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.82/jvm/xgboost4j_spark_tutorial.html#early-stopping)
* Special thanks to @CodingCat, @yanboliang, and @mingyang.

### Major bug fix: infrequent features should not crash distributed training (#4045)
* For infrequently occuring features, some partitions may not get any instance. This scenario used to crash distributed training due to mal-formed ranges. The problem has now been fixed.
* In practice, one-hot-encoded categorical variables tend to produce rare features, particularly when the cardinality is high.
* Special thanks to @CodingCat.

## v0.81 (2018.11.04)
### New feature: feature interaction constraints
* Users are now able to control which features (independent variables) are allowed to interact by specifying feature interaction constraints (#3466).
* [Tutorial](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.81/tutorials/feature_interaction_constraint.html) is available, as well as [R](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/9254c58e4dfff6a59dc0829a2ceb02e45ed17cd0/R-package/demo/interaction_constraints.R) and [Python](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/9254c58e4dfff6a59dc0829a2ceb02e45ed17cd0/tests/python/test_interaction_constraints.py) examples.

### New feature: learning to rank using scikit-learn interface
* Learning to rank task is now available for the scikit-learn interface of the Python package (#3560, #3848). It is now possible to integrate the XGBoost ranking model into the scikit-learn learning pipeline.
* Examples of using `XGBRanker` class is found at [demo/rank/rank_sklearn.py](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/24a268a2e3cb17302db3d72da8f04016b7d352d9/demo/rank/rank_sklearn.py).

### New feature: R interface for SHAP interactions
* SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. Previously, this feature was only available from the Python package; now it is available from the R package as well (#3636).

### New feature: GPU predictor now use multiple GPUs to predict
* GPU predictor is now able to utilize multiple GPUs at once to accelerate prediction (#3738)

### New feature: Scale distributed XGBoost to large-scale clusters
* Fix OS file descriptor limit assertion error on large cluster (#3835, dmlc/rabit#73) by replacing `select()` based AllReduce/Broadcast with `poll()` based implementation.
* Mitigate tracker "thundering herd" issue on large cluster. Add exponential backoff retry when workers connect to tracker.
* With this change, we were able to scale to 1.5k executors on a 12 billion row dataset after some tweaks here and there.

### New feature: Additional objective functions for GPUs
* New objective functions ported to GPU: `hinge`, `multi:softmax`, `multi:softprob`, `count:poisson`, `reg:gamma`, `"reg:tweedie`.
* With supported objectives, XGBoost will select the correct devices based on your system and `n_gpus` parameter.

### Major bug fix: learning to rank with XGBoost4J-Spark
* Previously, `repartitionForData` would shuffle data and lose ordering necessary for ranking task.
* To fix this issue, data points within each RDD partition is explicitly group by their group (query session) IDs (#3654). Also handle empty RDD partition carefully (#3750).

### Major bug fix: early stopping fixed in XGBoost4J-Spark
* Earlier implementation of early stopping had incorrect semantics and didn't let users to specify direction for optimizing (maximize / minimize)
* A parameter `maximize_evaluation_metrics` is defined so as to tell whether a metric should be maximized or minimized as part of early stopping criteria (#3808). Also early stopping now has correct semantics.

### API changes
* Column sampling by level (`colsample_bylevel`) is now functional for `hist` algorithm (#3635, #3862)
* GPU tag `gpu:` for regression objectives are now deprecated. XGBoost will select the correct devices automatically (#3643)
* Add `disable_default_eval_metric` parameter to disable default metric (#3606)
* Experimental AVX support for gradient computation is removed (#3752)
* XGBoost4J-Spark
  - Add `rank:ndcg` and `rank:map` to supported objectives (#3697)
* Python package
  - Add `callbacks` argument to `fit()` function of sciki-learn API (#3682)
  - Add `XGBRanker` to scikit-learn interface (#3560, #3848)

## v0.80 (2018.08.13)
* **JVM packages received a major upgrade**: To consolidate the APIs and improve the user experience, we refactored the design of XGBoost4J-Spark in a significant manner. (#3387)
  - Consolidated APIs: It is now much easier to integrate XGBoost models into a Spark ML pipeline. Users can control behaviors like output leaf prediction results by setting corresponding column names. Training is now more consistent with other Estimators in Spark MLLIB: there is now one single method `fit()` to train decision trees.
  - Better user experience: we refactored the parameters relevant modules in XGBoost4J-Spark to provide both camel-case (Spark ML style) and underscore (XGBoost style) parameters
  - A brand-new tutorial is [available](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.80/jvm/xgboost4j_spark_tutorial.html) for XGBoost4J-Spark.
  - Latest API documentation is now hosted at https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/.
* XGBoost documentation now keeps track of multiple versions:
  - Latest master: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest
  - 0.80 stable: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.80
  - 0.72 stable: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.72
* Support for per-group weights in ranking objective (#3379)
* Fix inaccurate decimal parsing (#3546)
* New functionality
  - Query ID column support in LIBSVM data files (#2749). This is convenient for performing ranking task in distributed setting.
  - Hinge loss for binary classification (`binary:hinge`) (#3477)
  - Ability to specify delimiter and instance weight column for CSV files (#3546)
  - Ability to use 1-based indexing instead of 0-based (#3546)
* GPU support

  - Use shared memory atomics for faster training (#3384).
  - Dynamically allocate GPU memory, to prevent large allocations for deep trees (#3519)
  - Fix memory copy bug for large files (#3472)
* Python package
  - Importing data from Python datatable (#3272)
  - Pre-built binary wheels available for 64-bit Linux and Windows (#3424, #3443)
  - Add new importance measures 'total_gain', 'total_cover' (#3498)
  - Sklearn API now supports saving and loading models (#3192)
  - Arbitrary cross validation fold indices (#3353)
  - `predict()` function in Sklearn API uses `best_ntree_limit` if available, to make early stopping easier to use (#3445)
  - Informational messages are now directed to Python's `print()` rather than standard output (#3438). This way, messages appear inside Jupyter notebooks.
* R package
  - Oracle Solaris support, per CRAN policy (#3372)
* JVM packages
  - Single-instance prediction (#3464)
  - Pre-built JARs are now available from Maven Central (#3401)

* Refactored C++ DMatrix class for simplicity and de-duplication (#3301)
* Refactored C++ histogram facilities (#3564)
* Refactored constraints / regularization mechanism for split finding (#3335, #3429). Users may specify an elastic net (L2 + L1 regularization) on leaf weights as well as monotonic constraints on test nodes. The refactor will be useful for a future addition of feature interaction constraints.
* Statically link `libstdc++` for MinGW32 (#3430)
* Enable loading from `group`, `base_margin` and `weight` (see [here](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/input_format.html#auxiliary-files-for-additional-information)) for Python, R, and JVM packages (#3431)

* GPU support
  - Continuous integration tests for GPU code (#3294, #3309)
  - GPU accelerated coordinate descent algorithm (#3178)
  - Abstract 1D vector class now works with multiple GPUs (#3287)
  - Generate PTX code for most recent architecture (#3316)

* Python package
  - FreeBSD support (#3247)
  - Validation of feature names in `Booster.predict()` is now optional (#3323)
* Updated Sklearn API
  - Validation sets now support instance weights (#2354)
  - `XGBClassifier.predict_proba()` should not support `output_margin` option. (#3343) See BREAKING CHANGES below.
* R package:
  - Better handling of NULL in `print.xgb.Booster()` (#3338)
  - Comply with CRAN policy by removing compiler warning suppression (#3329)

  - Update Spark to 2.3 (#3254)
  - Add scripts to cross-build and deploy artifacts (#3276, #3307)
  - Fix a compilation error for Scala 2.10 (#3332)
* BREAKING CHANGES
  - `XGBClassifier.predict_proba()` no longer accepts paramter `output_margin`. The paramater makes no sense for `predict_proba()` because the method is to predict class probabilities, not raw margin scores.

## v0.71 (2018.04.11)
* This is a minor release, mainly motivated by issues concerning `pip install`, e.g. #2426, #3189, #3118, and #3194.
  With this release, users of Linux and MacOS will be able to run `pip install` for the most part.
* Refactored linear booster class (`gblinear`), so as to support multiple coordinate descent updaters (#3103, #3134). See BREAKING CHANGES below.
* Fix slow training for multiclass classification with high number of classes (#3109)
* Fix a corner case in approximate quantile sketch (#3167). Applicable for 'hist' and 'gpu_hist' algorithms

  - Compatibility fixes for latest Spark versions (#3062, #3093)
* BREAKING CHANGES: Updated linear modelling algorithms. In particular L1/L2 regularisation penalties are now normalised to number of training examples. This makes the implementation consistent with sklearn/glmnet. L2 regularisation has also been removed from the intercept. To produce linear models with the old regularisation behaviour, the alpha/lambda regularisation parameters can be manually scaled by dividing them by the number of training examples.

## v0.6 (2016.07.29)
* Version 0.5 is skipped due to major improvements in the core
* Major refactor of core library.
  - Goal: more flexible and modular code as a portable library.
  - Switch to use of c++11 standard code.
  - Random number generator defaults to ```std::mt19937```.
  - Share the data loading pipeline and logging module from dmlc-core.
  - Enable registry pattern to allow optionally plugin of objective, metric, tree constructor, data loader.
    - Future plugin modules can be put into xgboost/plugin and register back to the library.
  - Remove most of the raw pointers to smart ptrs, for RAII safety.
* Add official option to approximate algorithm `tree_method` to parameter.
  - Change default behavior to switch to prefer faster algorithm.
  - User will get a message when approximate algorithm is chosen.
* Change library name to libxgboost.so
* Backward compatiblity
  - The binary buffer file is not backward compatible with previous version.
  - The model file is backward compatible on 64 bit platforms.
* The model file is compatible between 64/32 bit platforms(not yet tested).
* External memory version and other advanced features will be exposed to R library as well on linux.
  - Previously some of the features are blocked due to C++11 and threading limits.
  - The windows version is still blocked due to Rtools do not support ```std::thread```.
* rabit and dmlc-core are maintained through git submodule
  - Anyone can open PR to update these dependencies now.
* Improvements
  - Rabit and xgboost libs are not thread-safe and use thread local PRNGs
  - This could fix some of the previous problem which runs xgboost on multiple threads.
* JVM Package
  - Enable xgboost4j for java and scala
  - XGBoost distributed now runs on Flink and Spark.
* Support model attributes listing for meta data.
  - https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/pull/1198
  - https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/pull/1166
* Support callback API
  - https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/892
  - https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/pull/1211
  - https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/pull/1264
* Support new booster DART(dropout in tree boosting)
  - https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/pull/1220
* Add CMake build system
  - https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/pull/1314
