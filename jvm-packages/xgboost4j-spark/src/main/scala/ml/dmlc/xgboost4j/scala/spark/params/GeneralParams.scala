    * Rabit tracker configurations. The parameter must be provided as an instance of the

    *     case class TrackerConf(workerConnectionTimeout: Duration, trainingTimeout: Duration,
    *                            trackerImpl: String)
    *
    * See below for detailed explanations.
    *
    *   - trackerImpl: Select the implementation of Rabit tracker.
    *                  default: "python"
    *
    *        Choice between "python" or "scala". The former utilizes the Java wrapper of the
    *        Python Rabit tracker (in dmlc_core), and does not support timeout settings.
    *        The "scala" version removes Python components, and fully supports timeout settings.
    *
    *   - workerConnectionTimeout: the maximum wait time for all workers to connect to the tracker.
    *                             default: 0 millisecond (no timeout)
    *
    *        The timeout value should take the time of data loading and pre-processing into account,
    *        due to the lazy execution of Spark's operations. Alternatively, you may force Spark to
    *        perform data transformation before calling XGBoost.train(), so that this timeout truly
    *        reflects the connection delay. Set a reasonable timeout value to prevent model
    *        training/testing from hanging indefinitely, possible due to network issues.
    *        Note that zero timeout value means to wait indefinitely (equivalent to Duration.Inf).
    *        Ignored if the tracker implementation is "python".
