/**
  * Scala implementation of the Rabit tracker interface without Python dependency.
  * The Scala Rabit tracker fully implements the timeout logic, effectively preventing the tracker
  * (and thus any distributed tasks) to hang indefinitely due to network issues or worker node
  * failures.
  *
  * Note that this implementation is currently experimental, and should be used at your own risk.
  *
  * Example usage:
  * {{{
  *   import scala.concurrent.duration._
  *
  *   val tracker = new RabitTracker(32)
  *   // allow up to 10 minutes for all workers to connect to the tracker.
  *   tracker.start(10 minutes)
  *
  *   /* ...
  *      launching workers in parallel
  *      ...
  *   */
  *
  *   // wait for worker execution up to 6 hours.
  *   // providing a finite timeout prevents a long-running task from hanging forever in
  *   // catastrophic events, like the loss of an executor during model training.
  *   tracker.waitFor(6 hours)
  * }}}
  *
  * @param numWorkers Number of distributed workers from which the tracker expects connections.
  * @param port The minimum port number that the tracker binds to.
  *             If port is omitted, or given as None, a random ephemeral port is chosen at runtime.
  * @param maxPortTrials The maximum number of trials of socket binding, by sequentially
  *                      increasing the port number.

    *      (local dist, HDFS, S3 etc.) must be taken into account for the timeout value.
    *      If the timeout value is too small, the Rabit tracker will likely timeout before workers
    *      establishing connections to the tracker, due to the overhead of loading data.
    *      Using a finite timeout is encouraged, as it prevents the tracker (thus the Spark driver
    *      running it) from hanging indefinitely due to worker connection issues (e.g. firewall.)
