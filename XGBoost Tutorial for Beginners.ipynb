It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers in three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula \"all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus\".\n",
