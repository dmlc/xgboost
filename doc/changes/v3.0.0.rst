***********************
External Memory Support
***********************

This release features a major update to the external memory implementation with improved
performance, a new :py:class:`~xgboost.ExtMemQuantileDMatrix` for more efficient data
initialization, new feature coverage including categorical data support and quantile
regression support. Additionally, GPU-based external memory is reworked to support using
CPU memory as a data cache. Last but not least, we worked on distributed training using
external memory along with the spark package's initial support.

- A new :py:class:`~xgboost.ExtMemQuantileDMatrix` class for fast data initialization with
  the ``hist`` tree method. The new class supports both CPU and GPU training. (:pr:`10689`,
  :pr:`10682`, :pr:`10886`, :pr:`10860`, :pr:`10762`, :pr:`10694`, :pr:`10876`)
- External memory now supports distributed training (:pr:`10492`, :pr:`10861`). In addition, the
  Spark package can use external memory (the host memory) when the device is GPU. The
  default package on maven doesn't support RMM yet. For better performance, one needs
  to compile XGBoost from the source for now. (:pr:`11186`, :pr:`11238`, :pr:`11219`)
- Improved performance with new optimizations for both the ``hist``-specific training and
  the ``approx`` (:py:class:`~xgboost.DMatrix`) method. (:pr:`10529`, :pr:`10980`, :pr:`10342`)
- New demos and documents for external memory, including distributed training. (:pr:`11234`,
  :pr:`10929`, :pr:`10916`, :pr:`10426`, :pr:`11113`)
- Reduced binary cache size and memory allocation overhead by not writing the cut matrix. (:pr:`10444`)
- More feature coverage, including categorical data and all objective functions, including
  quantile regression. In addition, various prediction types like SHAP values are
  supported. (:pr:`10918`, :pr:`10820`, :pr:`10751`, :pr:`10724`)

Significant updates for the GPU-based external memory training implementation. (:pr:`10924`,
:pr:`10895`, :pr:`10766`, :pr:`10544`, :pr:`10677`, :pr:`10615`, :pr:`10927`, :pr:`10608`, :pr:`10711`)

- GPU-based external memory supports both batch-based and sampling-based training. Before
  the 3.0 release, XGBoost concatenates the data during training and stores the cache on
  disk. In 3.0, XGBoost can now stage the data on the host and fetch them by
  batch. (:pr:`10602`, :pr:`10595`, :pr:`10606`, :pr:`10549`, :pr:`10488`, :pr:`10766`,
  :pr:`10765`, :pr:`10764`, :pr:`10760`, :pr:`10753`, :pr:`10734`, :pr:`10691`,
  :pr:`10713`, :pr:`10826`, :pr:`10811`, :pr:`10810`, :pr:`10736`, :pr:`10538`,
  :pr:`11333`)
- XGBoost can now utilize `NVLink-C2C` for GPU-based external memory training and can
  handle up to terabytes of data.
- Support prediction cache (:pr:`10707`).
- Automatic page concatenation for improved GPU utilization (:pr:`10887`).
- Improved quantile sketching algorithm for batch-based inputs. See the section for
  :ref:`new features <3_0_features>` for more info.
- Optimization for nearly-dense input, see the section for :ref:`optimization
  <3_0_optimization>` for more info.

See our latest document for details :doc:`/tutorials/external_memory`. The PyPI package
(``pip install``) doesn't have ``RMM`` support, which is required by the GPU external
memory implementation. To experiment, you can compile XGBoost from source or wait for the
RAPIDS conda package to be available.

.. _3_0_networking:

**********
Networking
**********

Continuing the work from the previous release, we updated the network module to improve
reliability. (:pr:`10453`, :pr:`10756`, :pr:`11111`, :pr:`10914`, :pr:`10828`, :pr:`10735`, :pr:`10693`, :pr:`10676`, :pr:`10349`,
:pr:`10397`, :pr:`10566`, :pr:`10526`, :pr:`10349`)

The timeout option is now supported for NCCL using the NCCL asynchronous mode (:pr:`10850`,
:pr:`10934`, :pr:`10945`, :pr:`10930`).

In addition, a new :py:class:`~xgboost.collective.Config` class is added for users to
specify various options including timeout, tracker port, etc for distributed
training. Both the Dask interface and the PySpark interface support the new
configuration. (:pr:`11003`, :pr:`10281`, :pr:`10983`, :pr:`10973`)

****
SYCL
****

Continuing the work on the SYCL integration, there are significant improvements in the
feature coverage for this release from more training parameters and more objectives to
distributed training, along with various optimization (:pr:`10884`, :pr:`10883`).

Starting with 3.0, the SYCL-plugin is close to feature-complete, users can start working
on SYCL devices for in-core training and inference. Newly introduced features include:

- Dask support for distributed training (:pr:`10812`)

- Various training procedures, including split evaluation (:pr:`10605`, :pr:`10636`), grow policy
  (:pr:`10690`, :pr:`10681`), cached prediction (:pr:`10701`).

- Updates for objective functions. (:pr:`11029`, :pr:`10931`, :pr:`11016`, :pr:`10993`, :pr:`11064`, :pr:`10325`)

- On-going work for float32-only devices.  (:pr:`10702`)

.. _3_0_features:

********
Features
********

This section describes new features in the XGBoost core. For language-specific features,
please visit corresponding sections.

- A new initialization method for objectives that are derived from GLM. The new method is
  based on the mean value of the input labels. The new method changes the result of the
  estimated ``base_score``. (:pr:`10298`, :pr:`11331`)

- The :py:class:`xgboost.QuantileDMatrix` can be used with all prediction types for both
  CPU and GPU.

- In prior releases, XGBoost makes a copy for the booster to release memory held by
  internal tree methods. We formalize the procedure into a new booster method
  :py:meth:`~xgboost.Booster.reset` / :cpp:func:`XGBoosterReset`. (:pr:`11042`)

- OpenMP thread setting is exposed to the XGBoost global configuration. Users can use it
  to workaround hardcoded OpenMP environment variables. (:pr:`11175`)

- We improved learning to rank tasks for better hyper-parameter configuration and for
  distributed training.

  + In 3.0, all three distributed interfaces, including Dask, Spark, and PySpark, support
    sorting the data based on query ID. The option for the
    :py:class:`~xgboost.dask.DaskXGBRanker` is true by default and can be opted
    out. (:pr:`11146`, :pr:`11007`, :pr:`11047`, :pr:`11012`, :pr:`10823`, :pr:`11023`)

  + Also for learning to rank, a new parameter ``lambdarank_score_normalization`` is
    introduced to make one of the normalizations optional. (:pr:`11272`)

  + The ``lambdarank_normalization`` now uses the number of pairs when normalizing the
    ``mean`` pair strategy. Previously, the gradient was used for both ``topk`` and
    ``mean``. :pr:`11322`

- We have improved GPU quantile sketching to reduce memory usage. The improvement helps
  the construction of the :py:class:`~xgboost.QuantileDMatrix` and the new
  :py:class:`~xgboost.ExtMemQuantileDMatrix`.

  + A new multi-level sketching algorithm is employed to reduce the overall memory usage
    with batched inputs.
  + In addition to algorithmic changes, internal memory usage estimation and the quantile
    container is also updated. (:pr:`10761`, :pr:`10843`)
  + The change introduces two more parameters for the :py:class:`~xgboost.QuantileDMatrix`
    and :py:class:`~xgboost.DataIter`, namely, ``max_quantile_batches`` and
    ``min_cache_page_bytes``.

- More work is needed to improve the support of categorical features. This release
  supports plotting trees with stat for categorical nodes (:pr:`11053`). In addition, some
  preparation work is ongoing for auto re-coding categories. (:pr:`11094`, :pr:`11114`,
  :pr:`11089`) These are feature enhancements instead of blocking issues.
- Implement weight-based feature importance for vector-leaf. (:pr:`10700`)
- Reduced logging in the DMatrix construction. (:pr:`11080`)

.. _3_0_optimization:

************
Optimization
************

In addition to the external memory and quantile sketching improvements, we have a number
of optimizations and performance fixes.

- GPU tree methods now use significantly less memory for both dense inputs and near-dense
  inputs. (:pr:`10821`, :pr:`10870`)
- For near-dense inputs, GPU training is much faster for both ``hist`` (about 2x) and
  ``approx``.
- Quantile regression on CPU now can handle imbalance trees much more efficiently. (:pr:`11275`)
- Small optimization for DMatrix construction to reduce latency. Also, C users can now
  reuse the :cpp:func:`ProxyDMatrix <XGProxyDMatrixCreate()>` for multiple inference
  calls. (:pr:`11273`)
- CPU prediction performance for :py:class:`~xgboost.QuantileDMatrix` has been improved
  (:pr:`11139`) and now is on par with normal ``DMatrix``.
- Fixed a performance issue for running inference using CPU with extremely sparse
  :py:class:`~xgboost.QuantileDMatrix` (:pr:`11250`).
- Optimize CPU training memory allocation for improved performance. (:pr:`11112`)
- Improved RMM (rapids memory manager) integration. Now, with the help of
  :py:func:`~xgboost.config_context`, all memory allocated by XGBoost should be routed to
  RMM. As a bonus, all ``thrust`` algorithms now use async policy. (:pr:`10873`, :pr:`11173`, :pr:`10712`,
  :pr:`10712`, :pr:`10562`)
- When used without RMM, XGBoost is more careful with its use of caching allocator to
  avoid holding too much device memory. (:pr:`10582`)

****************
Breaking Changes
****************
This section lists breaking changes that affect all packages.

- Remove the deprecated ``DeviceQuantileDMatrix``. (:pr:`10974`, :pr:`10491`)
- Support for saving the model in the ``deprecated`` has been removed. Users can still
  load old models in 3.0. (:pr:`10490`)
- Support for the legacy (blocking) CUDA stream is removed (:pr:`10607`)
- XGBoost now requires CUDA 12.0 or later.

- Maintenance. (:pr:`11052`, :pr:`10380`)

**************
Python Package
**************

- The ``feature_weights`` parameter in the sklearn interface is now defined as
  a scikit-learn parameter. (:pr:`9506`)
- Initial support for polars, categorical feature is not yet supported. (:pr:`11126`, :pr:`11172`,
  :pr:`11116`)
- Reduce pandas dataframe overhead and overhead for various imports. (:pr:`11058`, :pr:`11068`)
- Better xlabel in :py:func:`~xgboost.plot_importance` (:pr:`11009`)
- Validate reference dataset for training. The :py:func:`~xgboost.train` function now
  throws an error if a :py:class:`~xgboost.QuantileDMatrix` is used as a validation
  dataset without a reference. (:pr:`11105`)
- Fix misleading errors when feature names are missing during inference (:pr:`10814`)
- Add Stacklevel to Python warning callback. The change helps improve the error message
  for the Python package. (:pr:`10977`)
- Remove circular reference in DataIter. It helps reduce memory usage. (:pr:`11177`)
- Add checks for invalid inputs for `cv`. (:pr:`11255`)
- Update Python project classifiers. (:pr:`10381`, :pr:`11028`)
- Support doc link for the sklearn module. Users can now find links to documents in a
  jupyter notebook. (:pr:`10287`)

- Dask

  + Prevent the training from hanging due to aborted workers. (:pr:`10985`) This helps
    Dask XGBoost be robust against error. When a worker is killed, the training will fail
    with an exception instead of hang.
  + Optional support for client-side logging. (:pr:`10942`)
  + Fix LTR with empty partition and NCCL error. (:pr:`11152`)
  + Update to work with the latest Dask. (:pr:`11291`)
  + See the :ref:`3_0_features` section for changes to ranking models.
  + See the :ref:`3_0_networking` section for changes with the communication module.

- PySpark

  + Expose Training and Validation Metrics. (:pr:`11133`)
  + Add barrier before initializing the communicator. (:pr:`10938`)
  + Extend support for columnar input to CPU (GPU-only previously). (:pr:`11299`)
  + See the :ref:`3_0_features` section for changes to ranking models.
  + See the :ref:`3_0_networking` section for changes with the communication module.

- Document updates (:pr:`11265`).
- Maintenance. (:pr:`11071`, :pr:`11211`, :pr:`10837`, :pr:`10754`, :pr:`10347`, :pr:`10678`, :pr:`11002`, :pr:`10692`, :pr:`11006`,
  :pr:`10972`, :pr:`10907`, :pr:`10659`, :pr:`10358`, :pr:`11149`, :pr:`11178`, :pr:`11248`)

- Breaking changes

  + Remove deprecated `feval`. (:pr:`11051`)
  + Remove dask from the default import. (:pr:`10935`) Users are now required to import the
    XGBoost Dask through:

    .. code-block:: python

       from xgboost import dask as dxgb

    instead of:

    .. code-block:: python

       import xgboost as xgb
       xgb.dask

    The change helps avoid introducing dask into the default import set.

  + Bump Python requirement to 3.10. (:pr:`10434`)
  + Drop support for datatable. (:pr:`11070`)

*********
R Package
*********

We have been reworking the R package for a few releases now. In 3.0, we will start
publishing a new R package on public repositories, likely R-universe, before moving toward
a CRAN update. The new package features a much more ergonomic interface, which is also
more idiomatic to R speakers. In addition, a range of new features are introduced to the
package. To name a few, the new package includes categorical feature support,
``QuantileDMatrix``, and an initial implementation of the external memory training.

Also, we finally have an online documentation site for the R package featuring both
vignettes and API references (:pr:`11166`, :pr:`11257`). A good starting point for the new interface
is the new ``xgboost()`` function. We won't list all the feature gains here, as there are
too many! Please visit the :doc:`/R-package/index` for more info. There's a migration
guide (:pr:`11197`) there if you use a previous XGBoost R package version.

- Support for the MSVC build was dropped due to incompatibility with R headers. (:pr:`10355`,
  :pr:`11150`)
- Maintenance (:pr:`11259`)
- Related PRs. (:pr:`11171`, :pr:`11231`, :pr:`11223`, :pr:`11073`, :pr:`11224`, :pr:`11076`, :pr:`11084`, :pr:`11081`,
