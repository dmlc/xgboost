XGBoost Release Policy
=======================

Versioning Policy
---------------------------

Starting from XGBoost 1.0.0, each XGBoost release will be versioned as [MAJOR].[FEATURE].[MAINTENANCE]

* MAJOR: We guarantee the API compatibility across releases with the same major version number. We expect to have a 1+ years development period for a new MAJOR release version.
* FEATURE: We ship new features, improvements and bug fixes through feature releases. The cycle length of a feature is decided by the size of feature roadmap. The roadmap is decided right after the previous release.
* MAINTENANCE: Maintenance version only contains bug fixes. This type of release only occurs when we found significant correctness and/or performance bugs and barrier for users to upgrade to a new version of XGBoost smoothly.


Making a Release
-----------------

1. Create an issue for the release, noting the estimated date and expected features or major fixes, pin that issue.
2. Bump release version.
   1. Modify ``CMakeLists.txt`` source tree, run CMake.
   2. Modify ``DESCRIPTION`` in R-package.
   3. Run ``change_version.sh`` in ``jvm-packages/dev``
3. Commit the change, create a PR on GitHub on release branch.  Port the bumped version to default branch, optionally with the postfix ``SNAPSHOT``.
4. Create a tag on release branch, either on GitHub or locally.
5. Make a release on GitHub tag page, which might be done with previous step if the tag is created on GitHub.
6. Submit pip, CRAN, and Maven packages.
   - The pip package is maintained by [Hyunsu Cho](http://hyunsu-cho.io/) and [Jiaming Yuan](https://github.com/trivialfis).  There's a helper script for downloading pre-built wheels on ``xgboost/dev/release-pypi.py`` along with simple instructions for using ``twine``.
   - The CRAN package is maintained by [Tong He](https://github.com/hetong007).
   - The Maven package is maintained by [Nan Zhu](https://github.com/CodingCat).
