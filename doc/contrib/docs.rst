Documents
*********
* Python and C documentation is built using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_.
* Each document is written in `reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_.
* You can build document locally to see the effect, by running

.. code-block:: bash

  make html

inside the ``doc/`` directory.  The online document is hosted by `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__ where the imported project is managed by `Hyunsu Cho <https://github.com/hcho3>`__ and `Jiaming Yuan <https://github.com/trivialfis>`__.

********
Examples

* Use cases and examples will be in `demo <https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/tree/master/demo>`_.
