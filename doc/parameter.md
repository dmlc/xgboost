XGBoost Parameters
==================
Before running XGboost, we must set three types of parameters: general parameters, booster parameters and task parameters.
- General parameters relates to which booster we are using to do boosting, commonly tree or linear model
- Booster parameters depends on which booster you have chosen
- Learning Task parameters that decides on the learning scenario, for example, regression tasks may use different parameters with ranking tasks.
- Command line parameters that relates to behavior of CLI version of xgboost.

Parameters in R Package
-----------------------
In R-package, you can use .(dot) to replace underscore in the parameters, for example, you can use max.depth as max_depth. The underscore parameters are also valid in R.

General Parameters
------------------
* booster [default=gbtree]
  - which booster to use, can be gbtree, gblinear or dart. gbtree and dart use tree based model while gblinear uses linear function.
* silent [default=0]
  - 0 means printing running messages, 1 means silent mode.
* nthread [default to maximum number of threads available if not set]
  - number of parallel threads used to run xgboost
* num_pbuffer [set automatically by xgboost, no need to be set by user]
  - size of prediction buffer, normally set to number of training instances. The buffers are used to save the prediction results of last boosting step.
* num_feature [set automatically by xgboost, no need to be set by user]
  - feature dimension used in boosting, set to maximum dimension of the feature

Parameters for Tree Booster
---------------------------
* eta [default=0.3, alias: learning_rate]
  - step size shrinkage used in update to prevents overfitting. After each boosting step, we can directly get the weights of new features. and eta actually shrinks the feature weights to make the boosting process more conservative.
  - range: [0,1]
* gamma [default=0, alias: min_split_loss]
  - minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.
  - range: [0,∞]
* max_depth [default=6]
  - maximum depth of a tree, increase this value will make the model more complex / likely to be overfitting.
  - range: [1,∞]
* min_child_weight [default=1]
  - minimum sum of instance weight (hessian) needed in a child. If the tree partition step results in a leaf node with the sum of instance weight less than min_child_weight, then the building process will give up further partitioning. In linear regression mode, this simply corresponds to minimum number of instances needed to be in each node. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.
  - range: [0,∞]
* max_delta_step [default=0]
  - Maximum delta step we allow each tree's weight estimation to be. If the value is set to 0, it means there is no constraint. If it is set to a positive value, it can help making the update step more conservative. Usually this parameter is not needed, but it might help in logistic regression when class is extremely imbalanced. Set it to value of 1-10 might help control the update
  - range: [0,∞]
* subsample [default=1]
  - subsample ratio of the training instance. Setting it to 0.5 means that XGBoost randomly collected half of the data instances to grow trees and this will prevent overfitting.
  - range: (0,1]
* colsample_bytree [default=1]
  - subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree.
  - range: (0,1]
* colsample_bylevel [default=1]
  - subsample ratio of columns for each split, in each level.
  - range: (0,1]
* lambda [default=1, alias: reg_lambda]
  - L2 regularization term on weights, increase this value will make model more conservative.
* alpha [default=0, alias: reg_alpha]
  - L1 regularization term on weights, increase this value will make model more conservative.
* tree_method, string [default='auto']
  - The tree construction algorithm used in XGBoost(see description in the [reference paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754))
  - Distributed and external memory version only support approximate algorithm.
  - Choices: {'auto', 'exact', 'approx'}
    - 'auto': Use heuristic to choose faster one.
      - For small to medium dataset, exact greedy will be used.
      - For very large-dataset, approximate algorithm will be chosen.
      - Because old behavior is always use exact greedy in single machine,
        user will get a message when approximate algorithm is chosen to notify this choice.
    - 'exact': Exact greedy algorithm.
    - 'approx': Approximate greedy algorithm using sketching and histogram.
* sketch_eps, [default=0.03]
  - This is only used for approximate greedy algorithm.
  - This roughly translated into ```O(1 / sketch_eps)``` number of bins.
    Compared to directly select number of bins, this comes with theoretical guarantee with sketch accuracy.
  - Usually user does not have to tune this.
    but consider setting to a lower number for more accurate enumeration.
  - range: (0, 1)
* scale_pos_weight, [default=1]
  - Control the balance of positive and negative weights, useful for unbalanced classes. A typical value to consider: sum(negative  cases) / sum(positive cases) See [Parameters Tuning](how_to/param_tuning.md) for more discussion. Also see Higgs Kaggle competition demo for examples: [R](../demo/kaggle-higgs/higgs-train.R ), [py1](../demo/kaggle-higgs/higgs-numpy.py ), [py2](../demo/kaggle-higgs/higgs-cv.py ), [py3](../demo/guide-python/cross_validation.py)
* updater, [default='grow_colmaker,prune']
  - A comma separated string defining the sequence of tree updaters to run, providing a modular way to construct and to modify the trees. This is an advanced parameter that is usually set automatically, depending on some other parameters. However, it could be also set explicitely by a user. The following updater plugins exist:
    - 'grow_colmaker': non-distributed column-based construction of trees.
    - 'distcol': distributed tree construction with column-based data splitting mode.
    - 'grow_histmaker': distributed tree construction with row-based data splitting based on global proposal of histogram counting.
    - 'grow_local_histmaker': based on local histogram counting.
    - 'grow_skmaker': uses the approximate sketching algorithm.
    - 'sync': synchronizes trees in all distributed nodes.
    - 'refresh': refreshes tree's statistics and/or leaf values based on the current data. Note that no random subsampling of data rows is performed.
    - 'prune': prunes the splits where loss < min_split_loss (or gamma).
  - In a distributed setting, the implicit updater sequence value would be adjusted as follows:
    - 'grow_histmaker,prune' when  dsplit='row' (or default) and prob_buffer_row == 1 (or default); or when data has multiple sparse pages
    - 'grow_histmaker,refresh,prune' when  dsplit='row' and prob_buffer_row < 1
    - 'distcol' when dsplit='col'
* refresh_leaf, [default=1]
  - This is a parameter of the 'refresh' updater plugin. When this flag is true, tree leafs as well as tree nodes' stats are updated. When it is false, only node stats are updated.
* process_type, [default='default']
  - A type of boosting process to run.
  - Choices: {'default', 'update'}
    - 'default': the normal boosting process which creates new trees.
    - 'update': starts from an existing model and only updates its trees. In each boosting iteration, a tree from the initial model is taken, a specified sequence of updater plugins is run for that tree, and a modified tree is added to the new model. The new model would have either the same or smaller number of trees, depending on the number of boosting iteratons performed. Currently, the following built-in updater plugins could be meaningfully used with this process type: 'refresh', 'prune'. With 'update', one cannot use updater plugins that create new nrees.

Additional parameters for Dart Booster

      - weight of new trees are 1 / (1 + learning_rate)

* rate_drop [default=0.0]
  - dropout rate (a fraction of previous trees to drop during the dropout).
  - range: [0.0, 1.0]
* one_drop [default=0]
  - when this flag is enabled, at least one tree is always dropped during the dropout (allows Binomial-plus-one or epsilon-dropout from the original DART paper).
* skip_drop [default=0.0]
  - Probability of skipping the dropout procedure during a boosting iteration.
    - If a dropout is skipped, new trees are added in the same manner as gbtree.
    - Note that non-zero skip_drop has higher priority than rate_drop or one_drop.
  - range: [0.0, 1.0]
