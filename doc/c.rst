XGBoost C Package
#################

XGBoost implements a set of C API designed for various bindings, we maintain the its
stability and the CMake/make build interface.  See ``demo/c-api/README.md`` for an
overview and related examples.  Also one can generate doxygen document by providing
``-DBUILD_C_DOC=ON`` as parameter to ``CMake`` during build, or simply look at function
comments in ``include/xgboost/c_api.h``.
