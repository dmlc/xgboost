XGBoost C Package
#################

XGBoost implements a set of C API designed for various bindings, we maintain its stability
and the CMake/make build interface.  See :doc:`/tutorials/c_api_tutorial` for an
introduction and ``demo/c-api/`` for related examples.  Also one can generate doxygen
document by providing ``-DBUILD_C_DOC=ON`` as parameter to ``CMake`` during build, or
simply look at function comments in ``include/xgboost/c_api.h``.
