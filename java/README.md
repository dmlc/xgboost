# xgboost4j
this is a java wrapper for xgboost 

the structure of this wrapper is almost the same as the official python wrapper.

core of this wrapper is two classes:

* DMatrix: for handling data

* Booster: for train and predict

## usage:
  please refer to [xgboost4j.md](doc/xgboost4j.md) for more information.

  besides, simple examples could be found in xgboost4j-demo:

  * Simple Train Example: org.dmlc.xgboost4j.demo.TrainMultiClassifierExample.java
  
  * Simple Predict Example: org.dmlc.xgboost4j.demo.PredictExample.java
  
  * Cross Validation Example: org.dmlc.xgboost4j.demo.CVExample.java
 

## build native library

for windows: open the xgboost.sln in windows folder, you will found the xgboostjavawrapper project, you should do the following steps to build wrapper library:
 * Select x64/win32 and Release in build
 * (if you have setted `JAVA_HOME` properly in windows environment variables, escape this step) right click on xgboostjavawrapper project -> choose "Properties" -> click on "C/C++" in the window -> change the "Additional Include Directories" to fit your jdk install path.
 * rebuild all
 * move the dll "xgboostjavawrapper.dll" to "xgboost4j/src/main/resources/lib/"(you may need to create this folder if necessary.) 

for linux: 
 * make sure you have installed jdk and `JAVA_HOME` has been setted properly
 * run "create_wrap.sh"
