# GPU Acceleration Demo

`cover_type.py` shows how to train a model on the [forest cover type](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype) dataset using GPU acceleration. The forest cover type dataset has 581,012 rows and 54 features, making it time consuming to process. We compare the run-time and accuracy of the GPU and CPU histogram algorithms.

`shap.ipynb` demonstrates using GPU acceleration to compute SHAP values for feature importance.
