An optimized general purpose gradient boosting library. The library is parallelized, and also provides an optimized distributed version.

It implements machine learning algorithms under the [Gradient Boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) framework, including [Generalized Linear Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model) (GLM) and [Gradient Boosted Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Gradient_tree_boosting) (GBDT). XGBoost can also be [distributed](#features) and scale to Terascale data

XGBoost is part of [Distributed Machine Learning Common](http://dmlc.github.io/) <img src=https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/11508361?v=3&s=20> projects

Version
-------

* Current version xgboost-0.4
  - [Change log](CHANGES.md)
  - This version is compatible with 0.3x versions

Features
--------
* Easily accessible through CLI, [python](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/demo/guide-python/basic_walkthrough.py),
  [R](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/R-package/demo/basic_walkthrough.R),
  [Julia](https://github.com/antinucleon/XGBoost.jl/blob/master/demo/basic_walkthrough.jl)
* Its fast! Benchmark numbers comparing xgboost, H20, Spark, R - [benchm-ml numbers](https://github.com/szilard/benchm-ml)
* Memory efficient - Handles sparse matrices, supports external memory
* Accurate prediction, and used extensively by data scientists and kagglers - [highlight links](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/doc/README.md#highlight-links)
* Distributed version runs on Hadoop (YARN), MPI, SGE etc., scales to billions of examples.

XGBoost in Graphlab Create
--------------------------
* XGBoost is adopted as part of boosted tree toolkit in Graphlab Create (GLC). Graphlab Create is a powerful python toolkit that allows you to do data manipulation, graph processing, hyper-parameter search, and visualization of TeraBytes scale data in one framework. Try the [Graphlab Create](http://graphlab.com/products/create/quick-start-guide.html)
* Nice [blogpost](http://blog.graphlab.com/using-gradient-boosted-trees-to-predict-bike-sharing-demand) by Jay Gu about using GLC boosted tree to solve kaggle bike sharing challenge:
