This is a Fork of XGBoost from https://github.com/tqchen/xgboost

In the main repo you already find 2 windows projects for the porting of the executable and the python library.
Here you have 
1) a c# dll wrapper, meaning the passage unmanaged to managed code
2) the c# Higgs Kaggle demo, instead of the python one

next steps:
I will upload a c# cv implementation for the demo very soon
