Description: This package is a R wrapper of xgboost, which is short for eXtreme
    Gradient Boosting. It is an efficient and scalable implementation of
    gradient boosting framework. The package includes efficient linear model
    solver and tree learning algorithms. The package can automatically do
    parallel computation with OpenMP, and it can be more than 10 times faster
    than existing gradient boosting packages such as gbm. It supports various
    objective functions, including regression, classification and ranking. The
    package is made to be extensible, so that users are also allowed to define
    their own objectives easily.
