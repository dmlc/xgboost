Description: Extreme Gradient Boosting, which is an efficient implementation
    of gradient boosting framework. This package is its R interface. The package
    includes efficient linear model solver and tree learning algorithms. The package
    can automatically do parallel computation on a single machine which could be
    more than 10 times faster than existing gradient boosting packages. It supports
    various objective functions, including regression, classification and ranking.
    The package is made to be extensible, so that users are also allowed to define
    their own objectives easily.
