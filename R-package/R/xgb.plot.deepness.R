#' Plot model tree depth
#'
#' Visualizes distributions related to the depth of tree leaves.
#' - `xgb.plot.deepness()` uses base R graphics, while
#' - `xgb.ggplot.deepness()` uses "ggplot2".
#'
#' @param model Either an `xgb.Booster` model, or the "data.table" returned by [xgb.model.dt.tree()].
#' @param which Which distribution to plot (see details).
#' @param plot Should the plot be shown? Default is `TRUE`.
#' @param ... Other parameters passed to [graphics::barplot()] or [graphics::plot()].
#'
#' @details
#'
#' When `which = "2x1"`, two distributions with respect to the leaf depth
#' are plotted on top of each other:
#' 1. The distribution of the number of leaves in a tree model at a certain depth.
#' 2. The distribution of the average weighted number of observations ("cover")
#'   ending up in leaves at a certain depth.
#'
#' Those could be helpful in determining sensible ranges of the `max_depth`
#' and `min_child_weight` parameters.
#'
#' When `which = "max.depth"` or `which = "med.depth"`, plots of either maximum or
#' median depth per tree with respect to the tree number are created.
#'
#' Finally, `which = "med.weight"` allows to see how
#' a tree's median absolute leaf weight changes through the iterations.
#'
#' These functions have been inspired by the blog post
#' <https://github.com/aysent/random-forest-leaf-visualization>.
#'
#' @return
#' The return value of the two functions is as follows:
#' - `xgb.plot.deepness()`: A "data.table" (invisibly).
#'   Each row corresponds to a terminal leaf in the model. It contains its information
#'   about depth, cover, and weight (used in calculating predictions).
#'   If `plot = TRUE`, also a plot is shown.
#' - `xgb.ggplot.deepness()`: When `which = "2x1"`, a list of two "ggplot" objects,
#'   and a single "ggplot" object otherwise.
