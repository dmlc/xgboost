#' Extract explaining the method:
#'
#' "We found that boosted decision trees are a powerful and very
#' convenient way to implement non-linear and tuple transformations
#' of the kind we just described. We treat each individual
#' tree as a categorical feature that takes as value the
#' index of the leaf an instance ends up falling in. We use
#' 1-of-K coding of this type of features.
#'
#' For example, consider the boosted tree model in Figure 1 with 2 subtrees,
#' where the first subtree has 3 leafs and the second 2 leafs. If an
#' instance ends up in leaf 2 in the first subtree and leaf 1 in
#' second subtree, the overall input to the linear classifier will
#' be the binary vector \code{[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}, where the first 3 entries
#' correspond to the leaves of the first subtree and last 2 to
#' those of the second subtree.
#'
#' [...]
#'
#' We can understand boosted decision tree
#' based transformation as a supervised feature encoding that
#' converts a real-valued vector into a compact binary-valued
#' vector. A traversal from root node to a leaf node represents
#' a rule on certain features."
