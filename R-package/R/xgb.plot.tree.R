#' Plot boosted trees
#'
#' Read a tree model text dump and plot the model.
#'
#' @details
#' The content of each node is visualized as follows:
#' - For non-terminal nodes, it will display the split condition (number or name
#'   if available, and the condition that would decide to which node to go
#'   next).
#' - Those nodes will be connected to their children by arrows that indicate
#'   whether the branch corresponds to the condition being met or not being met.
#' - Terminal (leaf) nodes contain the margin to add when ending there.
#'
#' The "Yes" branches are marked by the "< split_value" label.
#' The branches also used for missing values are marked as bold
#' (as in "carrying extra capacity").
#'
#' This function uses [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org/) as DiagrammeR
#' backend.
#'
#' @param model Object of class `xgb.Booster`. If it contains feature names
#'   (they can be set through [setinfo()], they will be used in the
#'   output from this function.
#' @param tree_idx An integer of the tree index that should be used. This
#'   is an 1-based index.
#' @param plot_width,plot_height Width and height of the graph in pixels.
#'   The values are passed to `DiagrammeR::render_graph()`.
#' @param with_stats Whether to dump some additional statistics about the
#'   splits.  When this option is on, the model dump contains two additional
#'   values: gain is the approximate loss function gain we get in each split;
#'   cover is the sum of second order gradient in each node.
#' @param ... Currently not used.
#' @return
#'
#' Rendered graph object which is an htmlwidget of ' class `grViz`. Similar to
#' "ggplot" objects, it needs to be printed when not running from the command
#' line.
