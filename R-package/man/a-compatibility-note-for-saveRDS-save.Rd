\title{Model Serialization and Compatibility}
\description{
When it comes to serializing XGBoost models, it's possible to use R serializers such as
\code{\link[=save]{save()}} or \code{\link[=saveRDS]{saveRDS()}} to serialize an XGBoost model object, but XGBoost also provides
its own serializers with better compatibility guarantees, which allow loading
said models in other language bindings of XGBoost.

Note that an \code{xgb.Booster} object (\strong{as produced by \code{\link[=xgb.train]{xgb.train()}}}, see rest of the doc
for objects produced by \code{\link[=xgboost]{xgboost()}}), outside of its core components, might also keep:
\itemize{
\item Additional model configuration (accessible through \code{\link[=xgb.config]{xgb.config()}}), which includes
model fitting parameters like \code{max_depth} and runtime parameters like \code{nthread}.
These are not necessarily useful for prediction/importance/plotting.
\item Additional R specific attributes  - e.g. results of callbacks, such as evaluation logs,
which are kept as a \code{data.table} object, accessible through
\code{attributes(model)$evaluation_log} if present.
}

The first one (configurations) does not have the same compatibility guarantees as
the model itself, including attributes that are set and accessed through
\code{\link[=xgb.attributes]{xgb.attributes()}} - that is, such configuration might be lost after loading the
booster in a different XGBoost version, regardless of the serializer that was used.
These are saved when using \code{\link[=saveRDS]{saveRDS()}}, but will be discarded if loaded into an
incompatible XGBoost version. They are not saved when using XGBoost's
serializers from its public interface including \code{\link[=xgb.save]{xgb.save()}} and \code{\link[=xgb.save.raw]{xgb.save.raw()}}.

The second ones (R attributes) are not part of the standard XGBoost model structure,
and thus are not saved when using XGBoost's own serializers. These attributes are
only used for informational purposes, such as keeping track of evaluation metrics as
the model was fit, or saving the R call that produced the model, but are otherwise
not used for prediction / importance / plotting / etc.
These R attributes are only preserved when using R's serializers.

In addition to the regular \code{xgb.Booster} objects produced by \code{\link[=xgb.train]{xgb.train()}}, the
function \code{\link[=xgboost]{xgboost()}} produces objects with a different subclass \code{xgboost} (which
inherits from \code{xgb.Booster}), which keeps other additional metadata as R attributes
such as class names in classification problems, and which has a dedicated \code{predict}
method that uses different defaults and takes different argument names. XGBoost's
own serializers can work with this \code{xgboost} class, but as they do not keep R
attributes, the resulting object, when deserialized, is downcasted to the regular
\code{xgb.Booster} class (i.e. it loses the metadata, and the resulting object will use
\code{\link[=predict.xgb.Booster]{predict.xgb.Booster()}} instead of \code{\link[=predict.xgboost]{predict.xgboost()}}) - for these \code{xgboost} objects,
\code{saveRDS} might thus be a better option if the extra functionalities are needed.

Note that XGBoost models in R starting from version \verb{2.1.0} and onwards, and
XGBoost models before version \verb{2.1.0}; have a very different R object structure and
are incompatible with each other. Hence, models that were saved with R serializers
like \code{\link[=saveRDS]{saveRDS()}} or \code{\link[=save]{save()}} before version \verb{2.1.0} will not work with latter
\code{xgboost} versions and vice versa. Be aware that the structure of R model objects
could in theory change again in the future, so XGBoost's serializers should be
preferred for long-term storage.

Furthermore, note that model objects from XGBoost might not be serializable with third-party
R packages like \code{qs} or \code{qs2}.

\details{
Use \code{\link[=xgb.save]{xgb.save()}} to save the XGBoost model as a stand-alone file. You may opt into
the JSON format by specifying the JSON extension. To read the model back, use
\code{\link[=xgb.load]{xgb.load()}}.

Use \code{\link[=xgb.save.raw]{xgb.save.raw()}} to save the XGBoost model as a sequence (vector) of raw bytes
in a future-proof manner. Future releases of XGBoost will be able to read the raw bytes and
re-construct the corresponding model. To read the model back, use \code{\link[=xgb.load.raw]{xgb.load.raw()}}.
The \code{\link[=xgb.save.raw]{xgb.save.raw()}} function is useful if you would like to persist the XGBoost model
as part of another R object.

Use \code{\link[=saveRDS]{saveRDS()}} if you require the R-specific attributes that a booster might have, such
as evaluation logs or the model class \code{xgboost} instead of \code{xgb.Booster}, but note that
future compatibility of such objects is outside XGBoost's control as it relies on R's
serialization format (see e.g. the details section in \link{serialize} and \code{\link[=save]{save()}} from base R).
