\alias{xgb.plot.tree}
\title{Plot a boosted tree model}
\usage{
xgb.plot.tree(feature_names = NULL, filename_dump = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{feature_names}{names of each feature as a character vector. Can be extracted from a sparse matrix (see example). If model dump already contains feature names, this argument should be \code{NULL}.}

\item{filename_dump}{the path to the text file storing the model. Model dump must include the gain per feature and per tree (\code{with.stats = T} in function \code{xgb.dump}).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} of the features used in the model with their average gain (and their weight for boosted tree model) in the model.
}
\description{
Read a xgboost model text dump.
Only works for boosted tree model (not linear model).
}
\details{
This is the function to plot the trees growned.
It uses Mermaid JS library for that purpose.
Performance can be low for huge models.

\examples{
data(agaricus.train, package='xgboost')

#Both dataset are list with two items, a sparse matrix and labels (labels = outcome column which will be learned).
#Each column of the sparse Matrix is a feature in one hot encoding format.
train <- agaricus.train

bst <- xgboost(data = train$data, label = train$label, max.depth = 2,
               eta = 1, nround = 2,objective = "binary:logistic")
xgb.dump(bst, 'xgb.model.dump', with.stats = T)

#agaricus.test$data@Dimnames[[2]] represents the column names of the sparse matrix.
xgb.plot.tree(agaricus.train$data@Dimnames[[2]], 'xgb.model.dump')
