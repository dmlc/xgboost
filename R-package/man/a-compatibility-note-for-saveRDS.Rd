\title{Do not use saveRDS() for long-term archival of models. Use xgb.save() instead.}
\description{
It is a common practice to use the built-in \code{saveRDS()} function to persist R objects to
the disk. While \code{xgb.Booster} objects can be persisted with \code{saveRDS()} as well, it
is not advisable to use it if the model is to be accessed in the future. If you train a model
with the current version of XGBoost and persist it with \code{saveRDS()}, the model is not
guaranteed to be accessible in later releases of XGBoost. To ensure that your model can be
accessed in future releases of XGBoost, use \code{xgb.save()} instead. For more details and
explanation, consult the page
