\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class \code{xgb.Booster}.}

\item{newdata}{Takes \code{data.frame}, \code{matrix}, \code{dgCMatrix}, \code{dgRMatrix}, \code{dsparseVector},
local data file, or \code{xgb.DMatrix}.

For single-row predictions on sparse data, it is recommended to use CSR format. If passing
a sparse vector, it will take it as a row vector.

Note that, for repeated predictions on the same data, one might want to create a DMatrix to
pass here instead of passing R types like matrices or data frames, as predictions will be
faster on DMatrix.

If \code{newdata} is a \code{data.frame}, be aware that:
\itemize{
\item Columns will be converted to numeric if they aren't already, which could potentially make
the operation slower than in an equivalent \code{matrix} object.
\item The order of the columns must match with that of the data from which the model was fitted
(i.e. columns will not be referenced by their names, just by their order in the data).
\item If the model was fitted to data with categorical columns, these columns must be of
\code{factor} type here, and must use the same encoding (i.e. have the same levels).
\item If \code{newdata} contains any \code{factor} columns, they will be converted to base-0
encoding (same as during DMatrix creation) - hence, one should not pass a \code{factor}
under a column which during training had a different type.
}}

\item{missing}{Float value that represents missing values in data
(e.g., 0 or some other extreme value).

This parameter is not used when \code{newdata} is an \code{xgb.DMatrix} - in such cases,
should pass this as an argument to the DMatrix constructor instead.}

\item{outputmargin}{Whether the prediction should be returned in the form of
original untransformed sum of predictions from boosting iterations' results.
E.g., setting \code{outputmargin = TRUE} for logistic regression would return log-odds
instead of probabilities.}

\item{predleaf}{Whether to predict per-tree leaf indices.}

\item{predcontrib}{Whether to return feature contributions to individual predictions (see Details).}

\item{approxcontrib}{Whether to use a fast approximation for feature contributions (see Details).}

\item{predinteraction}{Whether to return contributions of feature interactions to individual predictions (see Details).}

\item{training}{Whether the prediction result is used for training. For dart booster,
training predicting will perform dropout.}

\item{iterationrange}{Sequence of rounds/iterations from the model to use for prediction, specified by passing
a two-dimensional vector with the start and end numbers in the sequence (same format as R's \code{seq} - i.e.
base-1 indexing, and inclusive of both ends).

For example, passing \code{c(1,20)} will predict using the first twenty iterations, while passing \code{c(1,1)} will
predict using only the first one.

If passing \code{NULL}, will either stop at the best iteration if the model used early stopping, or use all
of the iterations (rounds) otherwise.

If passing "all", will use all of the rounds regardless of whether the model had early stopping or not.

Not applicable to \code{gblinear} booster.}

\item{strict_shape}{Whether to always return an array with the same dimensions for the given prediction mode
regardless of the model type - meaning that, for example, both a multi-class and a binary classification
model would generate output arrays with the same number of dimensions, with the 'class' dimension having
size equal to '1' for the binary model.

If passing \code{FALSE} (the default), dimensions will be simplified according to the model type, so that a
binary classification model for example would not have a redundant dimension for 'class'.

See documentation for the return type for the exact shape of the output arrays for each prediction mode.}

\item{avoid_transpose}{Whether to output the resulting predictions in the same memory layout in which they
are generated by the core XGBoost library, without transposing them to match the expected output shape.

Internally, XGBoost uses row-major order for the predictions it generates, while R arrays use column-major
order, hence the result needs to be transposed in order to have the expected shape when represented as
an R array or matrix, which might be a slow operation.

If passing \code{TRUE}, then the result will have dimensions in reverse order - for example, rows
will be the last dimensions instead of the first dimension.}

\item{validate_features}{When \code{TRUE}, validate that the Booster's and newdata's
feature_names match (only applicable when both \code{object} and \code{newdata} have feature names).

If the column names differ and \code{newdata} is not an \code{xgb.DMatrix}, will try to reorder
the columns in \code{newdata} to match with the booster's.

If the booster has feature types and \code{newdata} is either an \code{xgb.DMatrix} or
\code{data.frame}, will additionally verify that categorical columns are of the
correct type in \code{newdata}, throwing an error if they do not match.

If passing \code{FALSE}, it is assumed that the feature names and types are the same,
and come in the same order as in the training data.

Note that this check might add some sizable latency to the predictions, so it's
recommended to disable it for performance-sensitive applications.}

\item{base_margin}{Base margin used for boosting from existing model (raw score that gets added to
all observations independently of the trees in the model).

If supplied, should be either a vector with length equal to the number of rows in \code{newdata}
(for objectives which produces a single score per observation), or a matrix with number of
rows matching to the number rows in \code{newdata} and number of columns matching to the number
of scores estimated by the model (e.g. number of classes for multi-class classification).

Note that, if \code{newdata} is an \code{xgb.DMatrix} object, this argument will
be ignored as it needs to be added to the DMatrix instead (e.g. by passing it as
an argument in its constructor, or by calling \code{\link[=setinfo.xgb.DMatrix]{setinfo.xgb.DMatrix()}}.}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector or array, with corresponding dimensions depending on the prediction mode and on
parameter \code{strict_shape} as follows:

If passing \code{strict_shape=FALSE}:\itemize{
\item For regression or binary classification: a vector of length \code{nrows}.
\item For multi-class and multi-target objectives: a matrix of dimensions \verb{[nrows, ngroups]}.

Note that objective variant \code{multi:softmax} defaults towards predicting most likely class (a vector
\code{nrows}) instead of per-class probabilities.
\item For \code{predleaf}: a matrix with one column per tree.

For multi-class / multi-target, they will be arranged so that columns in the output will have
the leafs from one group followed by leafs of the other group (e.g. order will be \code{group1:feat1},
\code{group1:feat2}, ..., \code{group2:feat1}, \code{group2:feat2}, ...).

If there is more than one parallel tree (e.g. random forests), the parallel trees will be the
last grouping in the resulting order, which will still be 2D.
\item For \code{predcontrib}: when not multi-class / multi-target, a matrix with dimensions
\verb{[nrows, nfeats+1]}. The last "+ 1" column corresponds to the baseline value.

For multi-class and multi-target objectives, will be an array with dimensions \verb{[nrows, ngroups, nfeats+1]}.

The contribution values are on the scale of untransformed margin (e.g., for binary classification,
the values are log-odds deviations from the baseline).
\item For \code{predinteraction}: when not multi-class / multi-target, the output is a 3D array of
dimensions \verb{[nrows, nfeats+1, nfeats+1]}. The off-diagonal (in the last two dimensions)
elements represent different feature interaction contributions. The array is symmetric w.r.t. the last
two dimensions. The "+ 1" columns corresponds to the baselines. Summing this array along the last
dimension should produce practically the same result as \code{predcontrib = TRUE}.

For multi-class and multi-target, will be a 4D array with dimensions \verb{[nrows, ngroups, nfeats+1, nfeats+1]}
}

If passing \code{strict_shape=TRUE}, the result is always a matrix (if 2D) or array (if 3D or higher):
\itemize{
\item For normal predictions, the dimension is \verb{[nrows, ngroups]}.
\item For \code{predcontrib=TRUE}, the dimension is \verb{[nrows, ngroups, nfeats+1]}.
\item For \code{predinteraction=TRUE}, the dimension is \verb{[nrows, ngroups, nfeats+1, nfeats+1]}.
\item For \code{predleaf=TRUE}, the dimension is \verb{[nrows, niter, ngroups, num_parallel_tree]}.
}

If passing \code{avoid_transpose=TRUE}, then the dimensions in all cases will be in reverse order - for
example, for \code{predinteraction}, they will be \verb{[nfeats+1, nfeats+1, ngroups, nrows]}
instead of \verb{[nrows, ngroups, nfeats+1, nfeats+1]}.
}
\description{
Predict values on data based on XGBoost model.
}
\details{
Note that \code{iterationrange} would currently do nothing for predictions from "gblinear",
since "gblinear" doesn't keep its boosting history.

One possible practical applications of the \code{predleaf} option is to use the model
as a generator of new features which capture non-linearity and interactions,
e.g., as implemented in \code{\link[=xgb.create.features]{xgb.create.features()}}.

Setting \code{predcontrib = TRUE} allows to calculate contributions of each feature to
individual predictions. For "gblinear" booster, feature contributions are simply linear terms
(feature_beta * feature_value). For "gbtree" booster, feature contributions are SHAP
values (Lundberg 2017) that sum to the difference between the expected output
of the model and the current prediction (where the hessian weights are used to compute the expectations).
Setting \code{approxcontrib = TRUE} approximates these values following the idea explained
in \url{http://blog.datadive.net/interpreting-random-forests/}.

With \code{predinteraction = TRUE}, SHAP values of contributions of interaction of each pair of features
are computed. Note that this operation might be rather expensive in terms of compute and memory.
Since it quadratically depends on the number of features, it is recommended to perform selection
of the most important features first. See below about the format of the returned results.

The \code{predict()} method uses as many threads as defined in \code{xgb.Booster} object (all by default).
If you want to change their number, assign a new number to \code{nthread} using \code{\link[=xgb.model.parameters<-]{xgb.model.parameters<-()}}.
Note that converting a matrix to \code{\link[=xgb.DMatrix]{xgb.DMatrix()}} uses multiple threads too.

# use only the 1st tree

# verify that contributions' sums are equal to log-odds of predictions (up to float precision):

# for the 1st record, let's inspect its features that had non-zero contribution to prediction:
contr1 <- pred_contr[1,]
contr1 <- contr1[-length(contr1)]    # drop intercept
contr1 <- contr1[contr1 != 0]        # drop non-contributing features
contr1 <- contr1[order(abs(contr1))] # order by contribution magnitude

## multiclass classification in iris dataset:

lb <- as.numeric(iris$Species) - 1
num_class <- 3

set.seed(11)

    nthread = 2,
    subsample = 0.5,
    objective = "multi:softprob",
    num_class = num_class

# predict for softmax returns num_class probability numbers per case:
pred <- predict(bst, as.matrix(iris[, -5]))
str(pred)
# convert the probabilities to softmax labels
pred_labels <- max.col(pred) - 1
# the following should result in the same error as seen in the last iteration
sum(pred_labels != lb) / length(lb)

# compare with predictions from softmax:
set.seed(11)

pred <- predict(bst, as.matrix(iris[, -5]))
str(pred)
all.equal(pred, pred_labels)
# prediction from using only 5 iterations should result
# in the same error as seen in iteration 5:
pred5 <- predict(bst, as.matrix(iris[, -5]), iterationrange = c(1, 5))
