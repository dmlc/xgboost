\usage{
xgb.ggplot.importance(
  importance_matrix = NULL,
  top_n = NULL,
  measure = NULL,
  rel_to_first = FALSE,
  n_clusters = seq_len(10),
  ...
)

xgb.plot.importance(
  importance_matrix = NULL,
  top_n = NULL,
  measure = NULL,
  rel_to_first = FALSE,
  left_margin = 10,
  cex = NULL,
  plot = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{importance_matrix}{A \code{data.table} as returned by \code{\link[=xgb.importance]{xgb.importance()}}.}

\item{top_n}{Maximal number of top features to include into the plot.}

\item{measure}{The name of importance measure to plot.
When \code{NULL}, 'Gain' would be used for trees and 'Weight' would be used for gblinear.}

\item{rel_to_first}{Whether importance values should be represented as relative to
the highest ranked feature, see Details.}

\item{n_clusters}{A numeric vector containing the min and the max range
of the possible number of clusters of bars.}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed to \code{\link[graphics:barplot]{graphics::barplot()}}
(except \code{horiz}, \code{border}, \code{cex.names}, \code{names.arg}, and \code{las}).
Only used in \code{xgb.plot.importance()}.}

\item{left_margin}{Adjust the left margin size to fit feature names.
When \code{NULL}, the existing \code{par("mar")} is used.}

\item{cex}{Passed as \code{cex.names} parameter to \code{\link[graphics:barplot]{graphics::barplot()}}.}

\item{plot}{Should the barplot be shown? Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
The return value depends on the function:
\itemize{
\item \code{xgb.plot.importance()}: Invisibly, a "data.table" with \code{n_top} features sorted
by importance. If \code{plot = TRUE}, the values are also plotted as barplot.
\item \code{xgb.ggplot.importance()}: A customizable "ggplot" object.
E.g., to change the title, set \code{+ ggtitle("A GRAPH NAME")}.
}
}
\description{
Represents previously calculated feature importance as a bar graph.
\itemize{
\item \code{xgb.plot.importance()} uses base R graphics, while
\item \code{xgb.ggplot.importance()} uses "ggplot".
}
}
\details{
The graph represents each feature as a horizontal bar of length proportional to the
importance of a feature. Features are sorted by decreasing importance.
It works for both "gblinear" and "gbtree" models.

When \code{rel_to_first = FALSE}, the values would be plotted as in \code{importance_matrix}.
For a "gbtree" model, that would mean being normalized to the total of 1
("what is feature's importance contribution relative to the whole model?").
For linear models, \code{rel_to_first = FALSE} would show actual values of the coefficients.
Setting \code{rel_to_first = TRUE} allows to see the picture from the perspective of
"what is feature's importance contribution relative to the most important feature?"

The "ggplot" backend performs 1-D clustering of the importance values,
with bar colors corresponding to different clusters having similar importance values.
