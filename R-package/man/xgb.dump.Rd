\title{Dump an XGBoost model in text format.}
\usage{
xgb.dump(
  model,
  fname = NULL,
  fmap = "",
  with_stats = FALSE,
  dump_format = c("text", "json", "dot"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The model object.}

\item{fname}{The name of the text file where to save the model text dump.
If not provided or set to \code{NULL}, the model is returned as a character vector.}

\item{fmap}{Feature map file representing feature types. See demo/ for a walkthrough
example in R, and \url{https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/demo/data/featmap.txt}
to see an example of the value.}

\item{with_stats}{Whether to dump some additional statistics about the splits.
When this option is on, the model dump contains two additional values:
gain is the approximate loss function gain we get in each split;
cover is the sum of second order gradient in each node.}

\item{dump_format}{Either 'text', 'json', or 'dot' (graphviz) format could be specified.

Format 'dot' for a single tree can be passed directly to packages that consume this format
for graph visualization, such as function \code{DiagrammeR::grViz()}}

\item{...}{Not used.

Some arguments that were part of this function in previous XGBoost versions are currently
deprecated or have been renamed. If a deprecated or renamed argument is passed, will throw
a warning (by default) and use its current equivalent instead. This warning will become an
error if using the \link[=xgboost-options]{'strict mode' option}.

If some additional argument is passed that is neither a current function argument nor
a deprecated or renamed argument, a warning or error will be thrown depending on the
'strict mode' option.

\bold{Important:} \code{...} will be removed in a future version, and all the current
deprecation warnings will become errors. Please use only arguments that form part of
the function signature.}
}
\value{
If fname is not provided or set to \code{NULL} the function will return the model
as a character vector. Otherwise it will return \code{TRUE}.
