\title{Parse model text dump}
\usage{
xgb.model.dt.tree(model, trees = NULL, use_int_id = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Object of class \code{xgb.Booster}. If it contains feature names (they can
be set through \code{\link[=setinfo]{setinfo()}}), they will be used in the output from this function.

If the model contains categorical features, an error will be thrown.}

\item{trees}{An integer vector of (base-1) tree indices that should be used. The default
(\code{NULL}) uses all trees. Useful, e.g., in multiclass classification to get only
the trees of one class.}

\item{use_int_id}{A logical flag indicating whether nodes in columns "Yes", "No", and
"Missing" should be represented as integers (when \code{TRUE}) or as "Tree-Node"
character strings (when \code{FALSE}, default).}

\item{...}{Not used.

Some arguments that were part of this function in previous XGBoost versions are currently
deprecated or have been renamed. If a deprecated or renamed argument is passed, will throw
a warning (by default) and use its current equivalent instead. This warning will become an
error if using the \link[=xgboost-options]{'strict mode' option}.

If some additional argument is passed that is neither a current function argument nor
a deprecated or renamed argument, a warning or error will be thrown depending on the
'strict mode' option.

\bold{Important:} \code{...} will be removed in a future version, and all the current
deprecation warnings will become errors. Please use only arguments that form part of
the function signature.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with detailed information about tree nodes. It has the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Tree}: integer ID of a tree in a model (zero-based index).
\item \code{Node}: integer ID of a node in a tree (zero-based index).
\item \code{ID}: character identifier of a node in a model (only when \code{use_int_id = FALSE}).
\item \code{Feature}: for a branch node, a feature ID or name (when available);
for a leaf node, it simply labels it as \code{"Leaf"}.
\item \code{Split}: location of the split for a branch node (split condition is always "less than").
\item \code{Yes}: ID of the next node when the split condition is met.
\item \code{No}: ID of the next node when the split condition is not met.
\item \code{Missing}: ID of the next node when the branch value is missing.
\item \code{Gain}: either the split gain (change in loss) or the leaf value.
\item \code{Cover}: metric related to the number of observations either seen by a split
or collected by a leaf during training.
}

When \code{use_int_id = FALSE}, columns "Yes", "No", and "Missing" point to model-wide node identifiers
in the "ID" column. When \code{use_int_id = TRUE}, those columns point to node identifiers from
the corresponding trees in the "Node" column.

\description{
Parse a boosted tree model text dump into a \code{data.table} structure.
}
\details{
Note that this function does not work with models that were fitted to
categorical data, and is only applicable to tree-based boosters (not \code{gblinear}).

\examples{
# Basic use:

data(agaricus.train, package = "xgboost")
## Keep the number of threads to 1 for examples
nthread <- 1
data.table::setDTthreads(nthread)

bst <- xgb.train(
  data = xgb.DMatrix(agaricus.train$data, label = agaricus.train$label),
  nrounds = 2,
  params = xgb.params(
    max_depth = 2,
    nthread = nthread,
    objective = "binary:logistic"
  )
)

# This bst model already has feature_names stored with it, so those would be used when
# feature_names is not set:
dt <- xgb.model.dt.tree(bst)

# How to match feature names of splits that are following a current 'Yes' branch:
merge(
  dt,
  dt[, .(ID, Y.Feature = Feature)], by.x = "Yes", by.y = "ID", all.x = TRUE
)[
  order(Tree, Node)
]

}
