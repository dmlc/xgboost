\title{Get Quantile Cuts from DMatrix}
\usage{
xgb.get.DMatrix.qcut(dmat, output = c("list", "arrays"))
}
\arguments{
\item{dmat}{An \code{xgb.DMatrix} object, as returned by \code{\link[=xgb.DMatrix]{xgb.DMatrix()}}.}

\item{output}{Output format for the quantile cuts. Possible options are:
\itemize{
\item "list"\verb{will return the output as a list with one entry per column, where each column will have a numeric vector with the cuts. The list will be named if}dmat` has column names assigned to it.
\item \code{"arrays"} will return a list with entries \code{indptr} (base-0 indexing) and
\code{data}. Here, the cuts for column 'i' are obtained by slicing 'data' from entries
\code{   indptr[i]+1} to \code{indptr[i+1]}.
}}
}
\value{
The quantile cuts, in the format specified by parameter \code{output}.
}
\description{
Get the quantile cuts (a.k.a. borders) from an \code{xgb.DMatrix}
that has been quantized for the histogram method (\code{tree_method = "hist"}).

These cuts are used in order to assign observations to bins - i.e. these are ordered
boundaries which are used to determine assignment condition \verb{border_low < x < border_high}.
As such, the first and last bin will be outside of the range of the data, so as to include
all of the observations there.

If a given column has 'n' bins, then there will be 'n+1' cuts / borders for that column,
which will be output in sorted order from lowest to highest.

Different columns can have different numbers of bins according to their range.

\examples{
data(mtcars)

y <- mtcars$mpg
x <- as.matrix(mtcars[, -1])
dm <- xgb.DMatrix(x, label = y, nthread = 1)

# DMatrix is not quantized right away, but will be once a hist model is generated
model <- xgb.train(
  data = dm,
  params = xgb.params(tree_method = "hist", max_bin = 8, nthread = 1),
  nrounds = 3
)

# Now can get the quantile cuts
xgb.get.DMatrix.qcut(dm)
}
