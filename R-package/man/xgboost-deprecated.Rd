\title{Deprecation notices.}
\description{
At this time, some of the parameter names were changed in order to make the code style more uniform.
The deprecated parameters would be removed in the next release.
}
\details{
To see all the current deprecated and new parameters, check the \code{xgboost:::depr_par_lut} table.

A deprecation warning is shown when any of the deprecated parameters is used in a call. 
An additional warning is shown when there was a partial match to a deprecated parameter 
(as R is able to partially match parameter names).
