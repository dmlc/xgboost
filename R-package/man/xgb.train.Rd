\arguments{
\item{params}{List of XGBoost parameters which control the model building process.
See the \href{http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameter.html}{online documentation}
and the documentation for \code{\link[=xgb.params]{xgb.params()}} for details.

Should be passed as list with named entries. Parameters that are not specified in this
list will use their default values. Alternatively, parameters may be passed directly
as function arguments (accepted through \code{...}).

A list of named parameters can be created through the function \code{\link[=xgb.params]{xgb.params()}}, which
accepts all valid parameters as function arguments.}

\item{data}{Training dataset. \code{xgb.train()} accepts only an \code{xgb.DMatrix} as the input.

Note that there is a function \code{\link[=xgboost]{xgboost()}} which is meant to accept R data objects
as inputs, such as data frames and matrices.}

\item{nrounds}{Max number of boosting iterations.}

\item{evals}{Named list of \code{xgb.DMatrix} datasets to use for evaluating model performance.
Metrics specified in either \code{eval_metric} or \code{feval} will be computed for each
of these datasets during each boosting iteration, and stored in the end as a field named
\code{evaluation_log} in the resulting object. When either \code{verbose>=1} or
\code{\link[=xgb.cb.print.evaluation]{xgb.cb.print.evaluation()}} callback is engaged, the performance results are continuously
printed out during the training.
E.g., specifying \code{evals=list(validation1=mat1, validation2=mat2)} allows to track
the performance of each round's model on mat1 and mat2.}

\item{obj}{Customized objective function. Should take two arguments: the first one will be the
current predictions (either a numeric vector or matrix depending on the number of targets / classes),
and the second one will be the \code{data} DMatrix object that is used for training.

It should return a list with two elements \code{grad} and \code{hess} (in that order), as either
numeric vectors or numeric matrices depending on the number of targets / classes (same
dimension as the predictions that are passed as first argument).}

\item{feval}{Customized evaluation function. Just like \code{obj}, should take two arguments, with
the first one being the predictions and the second one the \code{data} DMatrix.

Should return a list with two elements \code{metric} (name that will be displayed for this metric,
should be a string / character), and \code{value} (the number that the function calculates, should
be a numeric scalar).

Note that even if passing \code{feval}, objectives also have an associated default metric that
will be evaluated in addition to it. In order to disable the built-in metric, one can pass
parameter \code{disable_default_eval_metric = TRUE}.}

\item{verbose}{If 0, xgboost will stay silent. If 1, it will print information about performance.
If 2, some additional information will be printed out.
Note that setting \code{verbose > 0} automatically engages the
\code{xgb.cb.print.evaluation(period=1)} callback function.}

\item{print_every_n}{Print each nth iteration evaluation messages when \code{verbose>0}.
Default is 1 which means all messages are printed. This parameter is passed to the
\code{\link[=xgb.cb.print.evaluation]{xgb.cb.print.evaluation()}} callback.}

\item{early_stopping_rounds}{If \code{NULL}, the early stopping function is not triggered.
If set to an integer \code{k}, training with a validation set will stop if the performance
doesn't improve for \code{k} rounds. Setting this parameter engages the \code{\link[=xgb.cb.early.stop]{xgb.cb.early.stop()}} callback.}

\item{maximize}{If \code{feval} and \code{early_stopping_rounds} are set, then this parameter must be set as well.
When it is \code{TRUE}, it means the larger the evaluation score the better.
This parameter is passed to the \code{\link[=xgb.cb.early.stop]{xgb.cb.early.stop()}} callback.}

\item{save_period}{When not \code{NULL}, model is saved to disk after every \code{save_period} rounds.
0 means save at the end. The saving is handled by the \code{\link[=xgb.cb.save.model]{xgb.cb.save.model()}} callback.}

\item{save_name}{the name or path for periodically saved model file.}

\item{xgb_model}{A previously built model to continue the training from.
Could be either an object of class \code{xgb.Booster}, or its raw data, or the name of a
file with a previously saved model.}

\item{callbacks}{A list of callback functions to perform various task during boosting.
See \code{\link[=xgb.Callback]{xgb.Callback()}}. Some of the callbacks are automatically created depending on the
parameters' values. User can provide either existing or their own callback methods in order
to customize the training process.

Note that some callbacks might try to leave attributes in the resulting model object,
such as an evaluation log (a \code{data.table} object) - be aware that these objects are kept
as R attributes, and thus do not get saved when using XGBoost's own serializaters like
\code{\link[=xgb.save]{xgb.save()}} (but are kept when using R serializers like \code{\link[=saveRDS]{saveRDS()}}).}

\item{...}{Other parameters to pass to \code{params}. See \code{\link[=xgb.params]{xgb.params()}} for more details.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{xgb.Booster}.
}
\description{
\code{xgb.train()} is an advanced interface for training an xgboost model.
The \code{\link[=xgboost]{xgboost()}} function is a simpler wrapper for \code{xgb.train()}.
}
\details{
These are the training functions for \code{\link[=xgboost]{xgboost()}}.

The \code{xgb.train()} interface supports advanced features such as \code{evals},
customized objective and evaluation metric functions, therefore it is more flexible
than the \code{\link[=xgboost]{xgboost()}} interface.

Parallelization is automatically enabled if OpenMP is present.
Number of threads can also be manually specified via the \code{nthread} parameter.

While in other interfaces, the default random seed defaults to zero, in R, if a parameter \code{seed}
is not manually supplied, it will generate a random seed through R's own random number generator,
whose seed in turn is controllable through \code{set.seed}. If \code{seed} is passed, it will override the
RNG from R.

The evaluation metric is chosen automatically by XGBoost (according to the objective)
when the \code{eval_metric} parameter is not provided.
User may set one or several \code{eval_metric} parameters.
Note that when using a customized metric, only this single metric can be used.
The following is the list of built-in metrics for which XGBoost provides optimized implementation:
\itemize{
\item \code{rmse}: Root mean square error. \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square_error}
\item \code{logloss}: Negative log-likelihood. \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-likelihood}
\item \code{mlogloss}: Multiclass logloss. \url{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html}
\item \code{error}: Binary classification error rate. It is calculated as \verb{(# wrong cases) / (# all cases)}.
By default, it uses the 0.5 threshold for predicted values to define negative and positive instances.
Different threshold (e.g., 0.) could be specified as \verb{error@0}.
\item \code{merror}: Multiclass classification error rate. It is calculated as \verb{(# wrong cases) / (# all cases)}.
\item \code{mae}: Mean absolute error.
\item \code{mape}: Mean absolute percentage error.
\item \code{auc}: Area under the curve.
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#'Area_under_curve} for ranking evaluation.
\item \code{aucpr}: Area under the PR curve. \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall} for ranking evaluation.
\item \code{ndcg}: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (for ranking task). \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDCG}
}

The following callbacks are automatically created when certain parameters are set:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=xgb.cb.print.evaluation]{xgb.cb.print.evaluation()}} is turned on when \code{verbose > 0} and the \code{print_every_n}
parameter is passed to it.
\item \code{\link[=xgb.cb.evaluation.log]{xgb.cb.evaluation.log()}} is on when \code{evals} is present.
\item \code{\link[=xgb.cb.early.stop]{xgb.cb.early.stop()}}: When \code{early_stopping_rounds} is set.
\item \code{\link[=xgb.cb.save.model]{xgb.cb.save.model()}}: When \code{save_period > 0} is set.
}

Note that objects of type \code{xgb.Booster} as returned by this function behave a bit differently
from typical R objects (it's an 'altrep' list class), and it makes a separation between
internal booster attributes (restricted to jsonifyable data), accessed through \code{\link[=xgb.attr]{xgb.attr()}}
and shared between interfaces through serialization functions like \code{\link[=xgb.save]{xgb.save()}}; and
R-specific attributes (typically the result from a callback), accessed through \code{\link[=attributes]{attributes()}}
and \code{\link[=attr]{attr()}}, which are otherwise
only used in the R interface, only kept when using R's serializers like \code{\link[=saveRDS]{saveRDS()}}, and
not anyhow used by functions like \code{predict.xgb.Booster()}.

Be aware that one such R attribute that is automatically added is \code{params} - this attribute
is assigned from the \code{params} argument to this function, and is only meant to serve as a
reference for what went into the booster, but is not used in other methods that take a booster
object - so for example, changing the booster's configuration requires calling \verb{xgb.config<-}
or \verb{xgb.model.parameters<-}, while simply modifying \verb{attributes(model)$params$<...>} will have no
effect elsewhere.
