\title{Generate plot of a single tree}
\usage{
xgb.plot.single.tree(model, feature_names, tree, plot_width = NULL,
  plot_height = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{dump generated by the \code{xgb.train} function.}

\item{feature_names}{names of each feature as a \code{character} vector. Can be extracted from a sparse matrix (see example). If model dump already contains feature names, this argument should be \code{NULL}.}

\item{plot_width}{width in pixels of the graph to produce}

\item{plot_height}{height in pixels of the graph to produce}

\item{...}{currently not used}
}
\value{
A diagram of the single tree
}
\description{
Generate plot of a single tree
}
\details{
For a gradient boosted tree ensemble of 10 rounds there are 10 trees that 
can be represented visually by this function.
