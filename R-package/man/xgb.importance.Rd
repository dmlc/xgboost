\usage{
xgb.importance(
  model = NULL,
  feature_names = getinfo(model, "feature_name"),
  trees = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Object of class \code{xgb.Booster}.}

\item{feature_names}{Character vector used to overwrite the feature names
of the model. The default is \code{NULL} (use original feature names).}

\item{trees}{An integer vector of (base-1) tree indices that should be included
into the importance calculation (only for the "gbtree" booster).
The default (\code{NULL}) parses all trees.
It could be useful, e.g., in multiclass classification to get feature importances
for each class separately.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with the following columns:

For a tree model:
\itemize{
\item \code{Features}: Names of the features used in the model.
\item \code{Gain}: Fractional contribution of each feature to the model based on
the total gain of this feature's splits. Higher percentage means higher importance.
\item \code{Cover}: Metric of the number of observation related to this feature.
\item \code{Frequency}: Percentage of times a feature has been used in trees.
}

For a linear model:
\itemize{
\item \code{Features}: Names of the features used in the model.
\item \code{Weight}: Linear coefficient of this feature.
\item \code{Class}: Class label (only for multiclass models). For objects of class \code{xgboost} (as
produced by \code{\link[=xgboost]{xgboost()}}), it will be a \code{factor}, while for objects of class \code{xgb.Booster}
(as produced by \code{\link[=xgb.train]{xgb.train()}}), it will be a zero-based integer vector.
}

If \code{feature_names} is not provided and \code{model} doesn't have \code{feature_names},
the index of the features will be used instead. Because the index is extracted from the model dump
(based on C++ code), it starts at 0 (as in C/C++ or Python) instead of 1 (usual in R).
}
\description{
Creates a \code{data.table} of feature importances.
}
\details{
This function works for both linear and tree models.

For linear models, the importance is the absolute magnitude of linear coefficients.
To obtain a meaningful ranking by importance for linear models, the features need to
be on the same scale (which is also recommended when using L1 or L2 regularization).
