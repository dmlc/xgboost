\usage{
\method{[[}{xgb.Booster}(x, i, exact = TRUE)

\method{$}{xgb.Booster}(x, name)

\method{$}{xgb.Booster}(x, name) <- value

\method{[[}{xgb.Booster}(x, i) <- value

\arguments{
\item{x}{An XGBoost model object (class \code{xgb.Booster}).}

\item{i, name}{The attribute to get/set.}

\item{exact}{Whether to allow partial maching. See \code{\link[=Extract]{Extract()}} for details.}

\item{value}{The value to set to.}

\description{
Getters and setters utilities for XGBoost object attributes.

Note: these methods are provided for convenience only. Be aware that booster objects
distinguish between R-level attributes (typically consisting of R objects and R metadata)
and booster-level attributes (JSON-only fields which are stored in the underlying booster
objects by the XGBoost core library, and which can be shared between different XGBoost
language bindings, typically used for attributes that are common between interfaces such
as the best iteration), the latter of which are not settable through these R methods, but
will nevertheless be returned by the getters.

It is highly recommended to use \code{attributes(x)} (R-level attributes) and/or \code{xgb.attr(x)}
(attributes handled through the XGBoost core library) for both getting and setting attributes.

Note that, despite giving the impression of working like an R list or struct objects,
\strong{these functions get and set object attributes} (as returned by function \code{\link[=attributes]{attributes()}}).

Note: \code{x[...]} slices boosters by rounds, while \code{x[[...]]} accesses attributes.

\details{
Name 'ptr' is reserved and cannot be assigned.

Attributes that are recognized by the core library (i.e. not specific to the R language
bindings of XGBoost) are not settable by these methods - use \code{\link[=xgb.attr<-]{xgb.attr<-()}} instead.

Important: it is not recommended to use these methods in packages that have XGBoost as
dependency. Methods \code{\link[=attributes]{attributes()}} and \code{\link[=xgb.attributes]{xgb.attributes()}} should be preferred instead.
